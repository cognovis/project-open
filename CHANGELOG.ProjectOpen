Change Log



==============================================================
V3.2.7.0 (V3.2.Beta4) Changes
==============================================================


Major Enhancements:
      * GanttProject Integration:
        Project Managers can now conveniently define and modify project
        structures with GanttProject and then upload the result into ]po[
	("round-trip integration"). 
	GanttProject is an open-source MS-Project clone written in Java.
	The combination of GanttProject and ]po[ offers an open	alternative 
	to MS-Project and MS-Project-Server.

      * "Web 1.5" GUI Overhaul:
      	We have improved the GUI to allow users to move their GUI components 
      	and to select/disable components. Also, we have added new icons and a 
      	new CSS.

      * Resource Planning and Resource Assignments:
        You can now add resources to projects and task and determine resource
        overload across projects.

      * Calendar:
	The new module shows project and task deadlines per day, week and month.
	Calendars can be either "shared" or "individual". Support for group 
	calendars will follow soon.

      * Bug-Tracker:
	]po[ now includes a fully fledged bug-tracker that compares to industry 
	leading bug trackers.

      * Expenses and Travel Costs:
        The new modules allows you to capture consultant's travel costs and 
        other expenses per project.

      * Reporting Engine:
	]po[ now includes its own reporting engine, similar to Crystal Reports
	or Jaspar Reports. A "reporting tutorial" explains step-by-step how to 
	write new reports. A graphical editor is not (yet) available.
	
      * System Configuration Wizard
        A new "SysConfig" wizard allows the first-time user to tailor the
        ]project-open[ installation for business sectors and company size,
        reducing the overall complexity.

      * "Petri-Net Workflow Engine":
        ]po[ now includes a fully-fledged workflow with graphical process editor.
        The WF can be used for example to set and confirm project budgets by
        senior executives, to priorize projects in a portfolio etc.

      * Project Templates:
        Project templates (creating new projects based on an existing
        project template) allows you to standardize and accelerate the
        generation of projects with similar schedules.

      * Dynamic Fields for Project, Companies and Users:
	We have greatly extended the "DynField" module to include DynFields
	in reports and CVS exports. Also, DynFields are now specific to
	object subtypes (for example: Type of projects).

      * New "Delivery Note" Financial Document Type
	Delivery notes are a step before issuing an invoice.




New Commercial "Enterprise Extension Modules":

The following modules are closed-source extensions of ]po[ covering the needs
of large organizations. These modules are available separately from the ]po[
product at http://www.project-open.com/shop/.

      * GAAP/IAS compliant Auditability
	This module captures all changes to financial objects and projects.

      * One-Time-Passwords:
      	Manages a list of TANs (Transaction Numbers) for one-time authentication
      	of users with special permissions (i.e. senior mannagers, accounting,...).

      * Profit Center Management & Permissions:
	The modules allows corporations to define fine-grain financial
	permissions across departments (who can see/modify the invoices of
	each department) and to calculate profit/loss per department.

      * SAP Integration:
	Import and export interfaces to SAP FI.


Minor Enhancements:

There were more then 500 minor enhancements in the last 6 months improving usability
and fixing bugs.

Major Enhancements:

      * Added fields "delivery address" and "contact person" in 
	financial document creation and editing pages.
      * Added separate counters for financial document numbers (invoices, 
	quotes and purchase orders). The old configuration (a single
	counter) is still the default.
      * "Create Company from User" wizard speeds up the creation
	of new users and their companies


]project-translation[ Specific Enhancements:

      * Added a "Aggregrate" checkbox in the translation invoice wizard.
	Unchecking this checkbox allows to create quotes and invoices with
	details (delivery date) of the individual translation tasks.

      * Added a "Translation Project Manager Performance" report to

	files. The feedback is converted into a forum item.


Minor Enhancements

      * Added a "redirect to log hours" function in ]project-consulting[,
	forcing people to log a certain amount of hours per week.

      * Financial documents can be sent as HTML attachments.
      * Automatic advancement of the "percent completed" filed in a project,
	depending on the state of both consulting and translation tasks
	the Translation Workflow Status 
      * Added date and currency format localization in the InvoiceViewPage.
	The locale is taken from the invoice template and allows to create
	correctly localized 
      * Enabled alphabetical sorting of projects in the timesheet page
	(this was quite difficult because of the hierarchical SQL query
	that includes subprojects and their tasks..)
      * Added "Nuke Demo Companies" option to cleanup selected "companies"
	when taking the system productively
      * "Search" field now clears up when clicking on it (if Full-Text 
	Search is installed)
      * Enhanced the permission system for the Filestorage: Now a number
	of privileges determines the default permissions, instead of the
	either very permissive or restictive settings before.
      * Added Windows-to-Linus and Linux-to-Windows conversion of parameters. 
	This function allows users to migrate database backup dumps easier 
	between a Linux version (production?) and a Windows version 
	(testing, development?)
      * Allowing to accept/reject multiple tasks of intranet-forum on the 
	home page. This makes it much quicker to deal with large amounts
	of minor bug reports.

	package
      * Fixed pagination in Translation ProjectListPage
      * Added several reports to intranet-reporting

Bug Fixes:

      * Fixed missing "invoice_office_id" in "Tigerpond" preconfigured
	demos.
      * Fixed "Finance" tab in projects in the preconfigured Demos: 
	Quotes and POs are summed up correctly but wouldn't appear in the 
	detailed list

	circumstances.
      * Fixed the Company's financial documents "more info..." link 
      * Fixed roject's "Profit & Loss" view in the "Tigerpond" demo systems. 
	This view was not enabled by default.
      * Fixed URLs in automatic alert emails: Outlooks breaks the lines

	now to avoid this situation (unless you've got a very long hostname...)
      * Fixed ugly JavaScript error if Full-Text Search is not installed
      * Fixed a few issues with "Nuke Demo Data". Includes the situation
	that a user has become manager of a cost center.
      * Fixed "Advanced Filtering" in the ProjectListPage
      * Relaxed security permissions for project budgets. 
	Now the "view_budget" privilege controls the visibility, instead
	of the (usually tighter) "view_finance"
      * Fixed bug in sending out multipart emails if the Subject includes a 
	newline character.
