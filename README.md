### ]project-open[ cognovís edition on GitHub

In the last couple of years cognovís has been developing additional features and bug fixes for ]project-open[. This repository contains all these modules and fixes and is primarily useful for our clients to provide them with an official download for their code base.

At cognovís we highly value our relationship with ]project-open[. We are providing the official code at https://github.com/project-open/ as well as the bundled version at https://github.com/cognovis/project-open-orig. Every couple of months we merge the official code from ]project-open[ back into our cognovís edition and the result is what you can download here.
