<h2>Overview</h2>
The mail tracking package is a helper package for acs-mail-lite to track outgoing E-Mails. It's goal is to allow sysadmin to install the package in addition to acs-mail-lite and have all the emails tracked for each object which the e-mail was about and the recipient, be it a TO, CC or BCC one, whether given with an actual E-Mail address or provided as a party_id. Additionally it easily integrates with contacts and project manager to display the mails for a contact / regarding a project.
<h2>Design</h2>
There are three tables which make up this package:
<ul>
<li>acs_mail_log: This table tracks all the emails themselves
<li>acs_mail_log_recipient_map: This maps the recipients which have a party_id in the OpenACS systems to the tracked E-Mail.
<li>acs_mail_log_attachment_map: This table keeps track of the files from the content repository that have been attached to the E-Mail.
</ul>
They are filled with a callback  acs_mail_lite::complex_send or  acs_mail_lite::send that are being called after successful sending of an E-Mail. This stores the data.
