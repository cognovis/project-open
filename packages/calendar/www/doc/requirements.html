Calendar Package Requirements</h2>

<hr>
<h3>
I. Introduction</h3>
A calendar is an aggregate of events which fall within a given time interval,
e.g., on a particular day, week, or month. The ArsDigita Calendar application
provides users with a tool which allows them to add, view, edit and organize
these events at both the personal and party/group levels.
<h3>
II. Vision Statement</h3> The ArsDigita Calendar application is a Web
based calendar system that can be accessed through any browser. The
application allows people to keep track of events as they normally
would on a paper calendar while giving them the opportunity to share
these events with other parties. Various types of additional
information related to a calendar item, such as an URL, a map indicating a
meeting's location, et cetera, can also be managed through the
Calendar application. The Calendar application also provides different
end-user specifiable presentation formats for viewing this
information.  In its current form, the Calendar application can be
integrated with other ACS components, for example, our Intranet
application and our Portals application; eventually the Calendar
application will integrate with yet further systems, for example, PDAs.

<p>Calendar objects have been designed to allow them to be tied to
particular ACS parties where each party member can see events
associated with that particular party. Events from the various parties
of which one is a member can also be shown on a party member's
personal calendar.  

<p>This package could be used for any application
where event tracking is important. This would include many
business, educational, club, and other community scenarios.
<h3>
III. System/Application Overview</h3> In our system, a
<b>party-specific event</b> is an event associated with a particular
party, typically of the sort scheduled by that party or of particular
interest to members of that party. For example, a reading group may
wish to associate an upcoming book signing event with their reading
group party using the Calendar application.

<p>A user's <b>calendar</b> is the aggregate of the party-specific
events which are associated with parties of which the user is a member
and which have been specified by this user as desirable for calendar
inclusion. Users will have the option to suppress the inclusion of all
party-specific events for a particular party of which they wish to
remain a member but the party-specific events of which they do not
wish to have appear on their calendars.  Since in our system, groups
are parties and parties can have calendars, this account of a user's
calendar generalizes to cover a party's calendar.  

<p>The Calendar Package is built on top of the ACS Event service
package and performs the following three high-level functions:
<ul>
<li>
Event Management</li>

<li>
Calendar Views</li>

<li>
Navigation</li>
</ul>
<b>Event Management</b> covers those aspects of the application which pertain
to events, such as adding, editing, viewing, deleting events, and
setting up recurring events. An <b>event </b>is defined as an <b>activity
</b>associated
with one or more time intervals. For instance, "participating in
an ACS bootcamp" is an activity, but "participating in the ACS bootcamp
during the upcoming week" is an event. Therefore, the Event Management
portion would also needs to deal with scheduling issues associated with
adding a temporal aspect to <b>activities </b>.
<p><b>Calendar Views</b> covers those aspects of the application which
pertain to the display of calendar events for a particular span of time.
<p><b>Navigation</b> covers those aspects of the application which pertain
to ways in which the end-user can change the timespan currently being displayed.
<h3>
IV. Use-cases and User-scenarios</h3>
There are three main classes of users for the Calendar:
<ul>
<li>
Individuals</li>

<li>
Groups and Parties</li>

<li>
Administrators</li>
</ul>
The <b>individual</b> is primarily interested in having a personal Web
based calendar. The calendar needs to support the manipulation of basic
calendar event components, among these: times, titles, and possibly descriptions. Example:
Irwin Individual wants to be able to manage his schedule from any Web browser
while travelling abroad. He should, by virtue of belonging to different
parties recognized by the system, be able to visit his calendar to
receive updates on party-specific events for these parties, retrieve clerical
information regarding his upcoming commitments, and add local events which
are specific to his travels.
<p><b>Groups and Parties</b> can have a collective calendar that stands
apart from the private individual calendar. This would be useful to display
calendar events for the public, for whom there is no individual calendar.
For example, ArsDigita can display a schedule of upcoming bootcamps, lectures
and other approved events on a calendar on arsdigita.com. A
common visitor does not have to be registered with the site to be able
to obtain this event information through their personal calendar.
To allow this functionality, the calendars for groups and parties would
need to support all the event managment and calendar views had by individual
calendars, and in addition, the role of calendar administrator must
be assigned to handle event managment.
<p><b>Administrators for</b> a group and party wide calendar are given
create, read, and write permissions on each individual item on the calendar.
He or she also has the privilege to change the permissions for each of
these items and also individual's ability to interact with these items.
For example, the side-wide administrator, Joe Admin, who also has the role
of the calendar administrator realizes that the date on which one of the
ACS bootcamps is scheduled to take place this month is incorrect. He has the permission to
change it. He also can grant Jane Bootcamp write permission on that particular
event, so that Jane can make changes on her own.
