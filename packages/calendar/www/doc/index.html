      <p>
The OpenACS calendar package is a web-based calendar package. In its current
      form it provides a UI for storing events that have a time or that last a
      day, and it offers a list view, a day, week, and month view.

      <p>
      The project plan for calendar can be found at <a href="
      http://openacs.org/projects/openacs/packages/calendar/">http://openacs.org/projects/openacs/packages/calendar/</a>.
      The maintainer of this package is <a
      href="mailto:openacs-calendar@dirkgomez.de">Dirk Gomez</a>

<h2>The Data Model</h2>
<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>
Calendar uses a lot of custom permissions. Most of them are unused and will be
removed eventually. It will then use a Unix-like set of read, write, create,
admin permissions.

<h3>Calendars</h3>
<p>
A calendar has a name and an owner and belongs to a package, it also is an
      acs_object. This goes into the table calendars. A calendar is created
      via the usual constructor - a "new" function" - and destroyed via the
      usual destructor - a "delete" function.
<p>
The calendar package currently uses its own little category system: calendar
      item types can be created per package, they are stored in the table
      cal_item_types

<p>
The table cal_party_prefs allows storing customization information per
      calendar and per user. It is completely unused and I couldn't find any traces of it
      ever having been used. A similar table will be used in a future version
      of calendar to store user options though.

    <h2>Code Contributors</h2>

    <ul>

    <li>Ben Adida - partial refactoring of the original OpenACS 4.X calendar,
    integration into .LRN

    <li>Gary Jin and W. Scott Meeks from late ArsDigita - original OpenACS 4.X
    calendar

    <li>Lars Pind and Paul Doerwald - pair programming during bug bashes 

    <li>Raad Al-Rawi from Cambridge University for calendar.css and a lot of
    the layout.

    <li>Lilian Tong and Charles Mok for the original PostgreSQL port
    </ul>

    <h2>Change Log</h2>

    <h3>Test Cases</h3>

of calendar, I am collecting the <a href="test-cases.html">test
cases</a> in this document.
