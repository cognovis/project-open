- Import the files of the test suite into an empty project and 
  check that the exported file is identical (or: deviates in a
  controlled way).

- Import the same files a 2nd time and check that nothing has
  changed.

- Export a project that has been defined in ]po[ to all three
  formats, and then re-import the file.



- Fields to be procesed during import/export:

	id			=> im_project.sort_order + im_timesheet_task.sort_order
	uid			=> im_timesheet_task.gantt_project_id
				=> im_project.project_nr (padded to the left with "0")
	name			=> im_project.project_name
	isnull			=> will be ignored by ]po[ if =1. Empty lines are not preserved.
	duration		=> im_timesheet_tasks.estimated_units + billable_units with UoM=Hour.
	remainingduration preserved
	start			=> im_project.start_date
	finish			=> im_project.end_date
	priority		=> im_project.priority
	notes			=> im_project.note
	outlinenumber		=> creates task hierarchy. => re-generated from hierarchy. 
	extendedattribute	=> exports task_nr
	predecessorlink		=> defines task dependencies
	milestone		=> im_projects.milestone_p

	outlinelevel		?
	calendaruid		ignored
	customproperty		only GP(?)
	task			only GP(?)
	depend			only GP(?)
