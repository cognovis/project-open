<h2>Spam System Requirements</h2>
by <a href="mailto:bschneid@arsdigita.com">Bill Schneider</a>

<hr>

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

<p>This document outlines the requirements for the spam system as it
will be implemented in ACS version 4.0.  Previous version of ACS
included a spam feature, and the spam system in ACS 4.0 will support
the same functionality as ACS 3.4 with the following enhancements:

<ul>

 <li>Administrators will send spam to groups of users using the same
code and pages as non-administrators sending spam to other group
members.  (In ACS 3.4, these two usage scenarios are carried out by
different sets of pages.)

</ul>

<h3>II. Vision Statement</h3>

Nearly all Web applications and Web-based communities have a way for
administrators to send a mass e-mail ("spam") to groups of people, or
for members of a group to send e-mail to all other members of the
group.  

<p>The ACS Spam system provides a mechanism for sending mass e-mail to
groups of users and viewing the history of these messages sent.  It
will be built using the existing ACS Messaging system, which stores
message content in the Content Repository.

<h3>System Overview</h3>

The ACS Spam system consists of:

<ul>

<li>An API for selecting groups of users as spam recipients 

<li>Pages for entering spam text

<li>A mail-merge feature, for filling in each recipient's name or
e-mail address in the message text 

<li>Administration pages for viewing previously-sent spam

</ul>

<h3>IV. Use-cases and User-scenarios</h3>

The spam system will be used by the following classes of users, which
may or may not overlap:

<ol>

<li><b>Site-wide or subsite administrators</b> use the spam system to
send e-mail to groups of users

<li><b>Package administrators</b> use the spam system to send e-mail
to groups of users based on some criteria within their package; for
example, a bboard administrator might send spam to all people who've
posted more than 30 messages within the last week, or an event
administrator might send e-mail to all users who registered for the
event.

<li><b>Site users</b> might use the spam system to send e-mail to
other users within their group, only if the subsite administration
allows non-administrators to initiate spam.

</ol>

<b>Spam sent by administrators</b>
<p>

An administrator uses the spam system to send e-mail to a group of users, 
following these steps:

<ol>

<li>Pick a group of users to receive a mass e-mailing

<li>Draft the e-mail

<li>View the text as it will appear to the recipient

<li>Confirm it

<li>The message is queued for delivery. 

</ol>

<p>This scenario is identical for site-wide, subsite, and and package
administrators, with the exception that package admins will only be
able to select groups of users based on criteria related to their
package, and not from the site/subsite at large.

<p><b>Spam sent by users</b>

<p>Users who are not administrators can also use the spam system, but
they can only send spam to other members of their group(s), and only
if the group administrator allows non-administrators to send spam.
The group administrator may set a spam moderation policy, so that spam
sent by a user will not be sent until an administrator confirms or approves
it.

<p><b>Viewing spam history</b>

An administrator can view the history of spam messages sent by other
administrators or users.  This will also show the status of messages
that have already been sent, but were not sent successfully (e.g.,
because of network problems or addresses that bounce).

<h3>VI. Requirements</h3>

<ul>
 <li><b>10.0</b> Pick a group of users as spam recipients

<p>Picking a group of recipients is always the first step in sending
a spam.  

<p><b>10.10</b> There must be an API for selecting a group of users
programmatically, so that an application that uses the spam system can 
present the option to spam a pre-chosen list of users.

<p><b>10.20</b> 
Subsite administrators should be able to spam any user group in the
<code>GROUPS</code> table for their subsite.  

<p><b>10.25</b> Site-wide administrators may spam any user group in
the <code>GROUPS</code> table for any subsite, or supply an arbitrary
SQL query for selecting a group of users from the <code>USERS</code>
or <code>PARTIES</code> tables directly.

<p><b>10.30</b> 
Users who are not administrators may send spam to a user group in the
<code>GROUPS</code> table, but only if they are members of that group 
and the group administrator specifies that non-administrators may 
send spam.  

<blockquote>

<p><b>10.30.10</b>

Group and subsite administrators should be able to specify that, when
a regular (non-admin) user sends spam to his group members, the spam
is not sent immediately, but delayed until confirmed by an
administrator.

</blockquote>

<p><li><b>20.0 Sending the e-mail</b>

<p><b>20.10</b> The spam system shall provide a standard mechanism
for drafting mass e-mail.

<p><b>20.20</b> The spam system shall allow the sender to specify a time
in the future to send the e-mail, so that spam may be sent on a delay

<p><b>20.30</b> The spam system shall provide a "mail-merge" feature,
with which the sender may specify fields to be filled in appropriately
for each recipient.  

<blockquote>
<p><b>20.30.10</b> These fields shall include, but are not
limited to the recipients'

<ul>
 <li>e-mail address
 <li>name
</ul>

</blockquote>

<li><b>30.0 Viewing spam history</b>

<p><b>30.10</b> Site-wide and subsite administrators should be able to
view a history of spam messages sent, and view/confirm those that are
pending.

<p><b>30.20</b> Administrators may view a history of previously-sent 
spam messages, along with any error conditions that were recorded during
the send.

</ul>
