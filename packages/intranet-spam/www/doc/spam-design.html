<h3>II. Introduction</h3>

The spam package allows the user to send mass e-mail to a group of
users, selected with a database query.  It provides a set of common
user-interface pages that can be linked from any other ACS application
that wishes to include a spam feature.  These pages will initally be
linked from the subsite admin/groups/one page, so subsite
administrators can send spam to all the members of a group.

<p>
The spam package uses the acs-mail package as the store for message
content, so all spam content also ends up in the
<code>acs_contents</code>; the acs-mail package also handles the
generation of multipart/alternative e-mail for us, and the actual
transport of outgoing message via <code>ns_sendmail</code>.

<p>The spam package is intended to be used as a singleton service, so
other applications can link to a single instance of the spam package.

<h3>III. Historical Considerations</h3>

Previous versions of ACS included a feature for sending mass e-mail to
groups of users.  There were two separate but nearly-identical sets of
pages for providing nearly the same features: one for administrators
to send spam to a group of users, and one for group members to spam
each other.  We expect that the enhanced object-level permissioning in
ACS 4.1 will prevent us from needing this kind of cut-and-paste
programming.

<h3>IV. Competitive Analysis</h3>

N/A

<h3>V. Design Tradeoffs</h3>

<h4>Picking groups of recipients</h4>

<p>Spamming groups of users chosen with different sets of criteria
 is a feature that can be incorporated into a variety of different
 applications; for example:

  <ul>

    <li>bboard: a forum admin sends mail to all users who have posted
more than N messages in D days

    <li>subsite: send mail to all users who are members of group G

    <li>file-storage: send mail to all users who have downloaded a file F

  </ul>
 
Ultimately, we would like the ability for each package author to
register a type of criteria centrally with a user-classes service; and
then the spam pages could present a central interface for picking a
group of users to spam based on cross-package criteria.  

<p>
This is part of a larger data-mining or personalization problem, and
is out of the scope of the current spam service.  So, for now, we 
require that each application provide a SQL query returning a list of
<code>party_id</code>'s as spam recipients as a parameter to the pages
that create a new spam message.  We prevent SQL tampering by
passing it as a client property (using
<code>ad_{get|set}_client_property</code>) instead of passing it as 
a URL variable.  

<h4>Use of acs-mail</h4>

<p>We use acs-mail for basic message storage and transport
services, since there is already an e-mail queue processing procedure,
and storing messages in the <code>acs_mail</code> table means that
outgoing spams are content items in the <code>acs_contents</code> 
table.  
<p>

Since acs-mail is still under development and its specifications
are subject to change, we will suggest some enhancements for acs-mail
as follows:

<ul>

<li>The mail-queue processor procedure
(<code>acs_mail_process_queue</code>) should use the user's
<code>prefer_text_only_p</code> setting in
<code>user_preferences</code>, and, in the case of
<code>multipart/alternative</code> mail, just send the user the
plain-text portion in case their mail reader is broken.

<li>We'd like to supply the name of a PL/SQL function that filters the
mail body content before it is sent to the user, given a party_id as a
parameter.  This would allow spam to implement a mail merge function,
without creating a trivially-different <code>acs_mail_body</code> for
each recipient.
</ul>

<h3>VI. API</h3>

<h4>Tcl</h4>

We will provide a procedure <code>spam_base</code> for returning the
base URL where the spam package is mounted.  This function will be
called from other packages to get a URL to the spam system.  We will
also provide a function that wraps the call to the PL/SQL functions
for inserting and updating messages in the database
(<code>spam_new_message</code> and <code>spam_update_message</code>).  

<p>
Also, we will include a "sweeper" procedure that periodically polls
for spam that has been approved by an administrator and whose
send-time has passed; these messages will be pushed into the acs-mail
service's outgoing mail queue (<code>acs_mail_queue_outgoing</code>)
for transport.

<h4>PL/SQL</h4>

<p>The spam system will extend the ACS Mail service, and will include
a PL/SQL package with a <code>new</code> function to create a new spam
message object.  There will also be an <code>edit</code> method for
editing a spam message, or updating its status fields.

<h3>VI. Data Model Discussion</h3>

Spam will not have much of its own data model; rather, it will extend
the acs-mail service's data model.  This allows us to build on top of
acs-mail rather than re-inventing it.  This also results in messages
being stored in the <code>acs-content</code> service, consolidating
our usage of BLOB columns in the database schema.

<p>Spam only needs to keep track of four things beyond what
acs-mail does:
<ul>

 <li>a SQL query for selecting users as recipients

 <li>a flag to indicate whether an outgoing spam has been approved by
 an administrator 

 <li>the date for the mail to be sent out

 <li>a flag to indicate whether an outgoing spam has been moved to the
outgoing queue, which should occur only after spam is approved and the
above send date has passed.  (Is there a way to make this a check 
constraint, e.g.,
<pre>
constraint spam_messages_sent_p_ck
check (sent_p = 'f' or (send_date >= sysdate and approved_p = 't')
</pre>
?  The question is, when adding such a constraint to the datamodel,
does Oracle treat <code>sysdate</code> as the time at which the constraint
is created, or at the time when the data is inserted?)

</ul>

<h3>VIII. User Interface</h3>

We will create the following pages as the spam user interface:

<ul>

<h4>End users</h4>

<li>
spam-add: creates a new row in spam_messages, and displays the main
spam-entry form; includes textarea for text, content-type radio
buttons (plain text/HTML), date-to-send widget, the count of users to
be spammed, and a confirmation button.  Form posts to spam-confirm.

<li>spam-confirm: displays text as it will go out and gives "are you sure"
button.  Posts to spam-send

<li>spam-send: updates all columns in spam_messages table.  Displays
confirmation method "you may edit with spam-edit or view status with
..."

<li>spam-edit: displays same form as spam-add, but posts to spam-update

<li>spam-update: does update instead of insert

<li>spam-status: shows the status of a single spam message; also gives
admins a widget to approve pending spam

<li>We will also modify the "group/one" page in acs-subsite to link to 
spam-add.

<h4>Subsite administrators</h4>

<li>spam-queue: display the entire spam_messages table with links to
spam-status

<li>spam-remove: delete/disable a spam message

<h4>ACS Administrators</h4> 

<li>ACS (site-wide) admins will have a page for entering arbitrary SQL
queries for picking groups of users.
</ul>
