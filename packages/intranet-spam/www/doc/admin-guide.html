<h3>Adding a spam link to another application</h3>

The spam service is a singleton and should be mounted on a single 
site-node URL, like <code>/spam</code>. 

<p>

Once the spam service is mounted, you may link to the spam system from
other packages to add a spam-all-users-who-meet-some-criteria feature.
You need to provide a SQL query that returns a list of
<code>party_id</code>'s, and the <code>object_id</code> of the object
that controls the spam.   These parameters to the spam system are
passed with <code>ad_set_client_property</code> rather than through
the URL/form variables for security and efficiency.  

<p>

For example, you can create a link to spam all group members from the
<code>/admin/groups/one.tcl</code> page in acs-subsite with this code:

<blockquote><code><pre>
# note: you should add "spam_url:onevalue" to ad_page_contract

set sql_query "select member_id as party_id 
     from group_member_map m 
     where group_id = $group_id"

ad_set_client_property spam "sql_query" $sql_query
ad_set_client_property spam "object_id" $group_id

set spam_url "[spam_base]spam-add?"
</pre></code></blockquote>

and adding the link to to the template <code>one.adp</code>:

<blockquote><code><pre>
&lt;p>
 &lt;a href="@spam_url@">Spam all members&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
</blockquote></code></pre>

</h3>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

A spam message inherits the permissions of whatever
<code>object_id</code> is passed into the <code>spam-add</code> page.
You need to have <code>write</code> permissions on that object to
create a new spam message or edit an existing spam message; and you
need <code>admin</code> permission on that object for the spam to be
considered "approved" or to approve an unapproved spam. A spam message
will not actually be queued for sending unless it is approved.
