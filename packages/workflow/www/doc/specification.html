<p>
  By <a href="http://www.pinds.com">Lars Pind</a>
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  I recently built a typical workflow-based application, <a
  href="http://clients.museatech.net/bug-tracker/">bug-tracker</a>,
  and decided against using the acs-workflow package that I myself
  built. That's not a good recommendation. We need to fix that.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
  The goal is to implement a workflow package that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Is ideally suited for at least 3 use-cases: Bug-tracker, CMS-style
    publication process, and simple approval.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gives people a usable UI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Can be used entirely through a clean Tcl API
  </li>
  <li>
    Doesn't require people to learn Petri Nets
  </li>
  <li>
    Is much easier for developers to use in their applications
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Gripes with the current acs-workflow:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Engine is in PL/SQL, not in Tcl, which makes it hard to write
    callbacks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Petri net is just too complicated for people to learn how to use,
    and there are too many ways for them to mess up. The primary
    benefit is parallel routing, which I've never actually come across
    any applications that seriously needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The UI sucks, and it's really hard to use workflow without using
    the interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    Graphviz is actually not terribly great at displaying workflow
    nets, as it tries to fit everything into a circle, whereas most of
    the time with workflow what you really want is to have it appear
    as a nice sequence of events with some loops back here and there.
  </li>
  <li>
    It's too restrictive and inflexible. It's hard to change your mind
    and go back, or to manually bash the case into a certain state.
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    Also, it was never finished. Unfortunately, finishing it would be
    a tremendous amount of work for limited benefit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Data model has some big issues: Workflows are object
    types. Workflows aren't tied to packages, and the context idea
    isn't working very well. It's based on petri nets.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Finite State Machine</h2>

<p>
  Take bug-tracker as an example. The bug-tracker workflow and user
  interface can be defined as:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Roles</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Submitter</li>
      <li>Assignee</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>States</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Open</li>
      <li>Resolved</li>
      <li>Closed</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Actions</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Resolve: Enabled in states open and resolved; changes state to
        resolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close: Enabled in state resolved; changes state to closed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reopen: Enabled in states resolved, closed; changes state to open.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edit: Enabled in all states; no changes to state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Comment: Enabled in all states; no changes to state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reassign: Enabled in states open, resolved; no changes to state.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  I've finally come to the realization that we'll be better off in the
  short to medium term with just a well-functioning implementation of
  a finite state machine based workflow module. In general, a workflow
  consists of a finite set of states, and a finite set of
  actions. Each action has a set of states in which it's enabled,
  or it can be always enabled in all states. And each action can
  cause the workflow case to move into a new state, or it can leave
  the state unaltered.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the ability to have an action enabled in more than one
  state is a convenience, and not part of the mathematical model of
  finite state machines. Likeways with actions that don't change the
  state. But it's mighty convenient, as you've seen illustrated by the
  bug-tracker example above.
</p>

<h2>Workflows</h2>

<p>
  A workflow is a set of roles, actions, and states, and their relations.
</p>

<p>
  A workflow is associated with an object, which would typically be one
  of the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    A <b>package type</b>: This is the default workflow for the
    bug-tracker package.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <b>package instance</b>: This is the default workflow for a
    particular instance of the bug-tracker package.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <b>single case</b>: Future versions could allow you to customize
    your workflow for a particular bug or content story.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  There's also a short_name, so you can easily distinguish between
  multiple workflows for the same package, e.g., one for handling the
  bug, and another for approving creation of new versions or
  components in the bug-tracker.
</p>

<p>
  A workflow is also associated with an <b>object type</b>. The reason
  for this is that assignments will frequently depend on attributes of
  the specific object for the case. In bug-tracker, for example, the
  default assignee for a bug will be the maintainer of the component
  in which the bug has been found. The bug-tracker will provide one or
  more assignment service contract implementations, which, given the
  bug_id will give you the component maintainer, or the project
  maintainer. These can be used to set up automatic assignment through
  a nice web-based user interface.
</p>

<p>
  When you create a new workflow case for a specific object, we will
  check that this object descends from the object type for which the
  workflow is for. If your workflow is general enough to work for all
  object types, then you can simply associate it with the common
  ancestor of all objects, 'acs_object'.
</p>

<p>
  When you create a new instance of the bug-tracker, we would <b>make
  a copy</b> of the default bug-tracker workflow for your particular
  package, so that you can make local changes to the workflow, to the
  assignments, etc.
</p>

<p>
  A workflow can have <b>side-effects</b>, which fire when <b>any</b>
  action is triggered on that workflow. These fire after the specific
  actions. See more under action side-effects. These are declared as
  a standard "Action_SideEffect" service contract implementation.
</p>

<p>
  Another service contract on the workflow level is the <b>activity
  log entry title formatting</b> contract. Using a side-effect
  callback, you can store additional key/value pairs in the activity
  log. You can use the title formatting service contract to pull these
  out, along with any other data you like, and use them to format the
  title of the log entry for display.
</p>

<h2>Roles</h2>

<p>
  A workflow has a set of roles. For bug-tracker, this is Submitter,
  and Assignee. More complex bug-tracker workflows, could add Triager
  and Tester. For a typical pulication workflow, you'd have Author,
  Editor, and Publisher. Normally, you'd always include an
  'Administrator' role.
</p>

<p>
  Each role is associated wtih one or more actions in the
  workflow. The assignee is assigned to the 'Resolve' action, but also
  has permission to perform the Edit, Comment and Reassign
  actions. The submitter is assigned to the 'Close' action, but also
  has permission to 'Reopen', 'Edit', 'Comment', and possibly
  'Reassign'.
</p>

<p>
  The idea behind introducing roles is that you do not want to go
  through the bother of assigning each action individually, when
  normally they are grouped together.
</p>

<p>
  Then, as the workflow case unfolds, people are given roles--you
  will be the submitter, you will be the assignee. Roles can get
  reassigned at any time. 
</p>

<h3>Default Assignment</h3>

<p>
  The tricky part, however, is the rules saying who should be assigned
  by default, or who <i>can</i> be assigned to this role. First, let's
  look at how the <b>default assignees</b> can be determined.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    If you only have one publisher, then you simply want to
    assign the Publisher role to that publisher always. That's
    called a <b>static assignment</b>, and the information about that
    current assignee is kept in the workflow data model.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Submitter role in bug-tracker, you want to assign to whoever
    opened the bug, namely the <b>object creation user</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Assignee role in bug-tracker is given to the maintainer of the
    component in which the bug was found. This is an example of a completely
    <b>application-specific</b> assignment, one which is only relevant
    for bug-tracker bug objects, because we need to know the
    particular bug-tracker data model for this to work.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  These different options are supplied by programmers as
  implementations of a particular service contract (see below under
  <a hred="#service-contracts">service contracts</a>).
</p>

<p>
  In the definition of a workflow, you can select <b>an ordered list
  of default assignment methods</b> Each will be tried in the order
  you specify. The first to return a non-empty list of assignees is
  the one which will be used, and the rest won't get called. So for
  example you can say "first try component maintainer, and if non is
  specified, use the project maintainer".
</p>

<p>
  The workflow package will supply a few standard implementations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Creation user: Assign to the user who created the given object.
  </li>
  <li>
    Static assignee: Use the static assignment from the workflow definition.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Default assignment is done in a lazy fashion, in that we don't try
  to find the default assignees until we need to. We need to the first
  time an action assigned to that role is enabled. This allows your
  default assignment to depend on things that happened in prior tasks.
</p>

<h3>Reassignment</h3>

<p>
  Now, let's look at what happens when you want to reassign a role to
  someone else. 
  the 
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    If you want to reassign the role, the user interface offers a
    <b>pick-list</b> of the users and groups which you're most likely
    to want to reassign the role to. Who they are will depend on the
    particular application. One common idea is to display the users
    who are currently assigned to this role in other cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the desired person or group wasn't in the pick-list, you can
    <b>search</b>. The search is conducted among all the users who
    could possibly be assigned to this role, which, again, will depend
    on the application. It could be all registered users on the site,
    it could be all members of the nearest surrounding subsite, it
    could be all members of a particular named group, or it could be
    some other calculation based on the application.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  A couple of default implementations will be supplied by the workflow
  package. For the pick-list:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Current assigness: Returns the list of parties who are currently
    assigned to this role in this workflow (for example, all the
    current assignees in this bug-tracker instance).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For the search query:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Registered users: No limitation, search among all registered
    users. Simply returns a query name for "cc_users".
  </li>
  <li>
    Nearest subsite members: Limit to members of the nearest subsite
    above the current package.
  </li>
  <li>
    Static allowed assignment: The users defined as the allowed
    parties in the workflow_role_allowed_parties table.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Actions</h2>

<p>
  In order to determine who are <i>supposed</i> to perform an
  action, and who are <i>allowed</i> to perform the action, we let you
  specify these three things for each action:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Assigned role(s)</b>: People who are mapped to this role will
    be <i>assigned</i> to this action, e.g., the submitter is assigned
    to the Close action once the bug is resolved. When you're assigned
    to something, you're expected to go and do something about it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Allowed role(s)</b>: People who are mapped to this role will
    have the <i>permission</i> to perform this action, e.g., the
    submitter is allowed to Reopen the bug once it's resolved, but not
    assigned to it. She's only assigned to "Close".
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Privileges</b>: People who have these privileges on the object
    pointed to by workflow_case.object_id (e.g. the bug object for
    bug-tracker) will also have <i>permission</i> to do perform this
    action. Same as above, but allows for using permissions to grant
    'feedback', 'write', and 'admin', for example.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Actions can also have <b>side-effects</b>, which simply means that
  whenever an action is triggered, one or more specified service
  contract implementations will get executed. These side-effects are
  executed <b>after</b> all other updates, both to the case object,
  and to the workflow tables, have been completed.
</p>

<h2>States</h2>

<p>
  This is specific to the FSM-model. A workflow has a finite set of
  states, for example "open", "resolved", and "closed". A case will
  always be in exactly one such state. When you perform an action, the
  workflow can be pushed into a new state. 
</p>

<p>
  There will be one initial state, which the workflow will start out
  in. This will be the first state according to the sort order from
  workflow_fsm_states
</p>

<p>
  States have almost no information associated with them, they're
  simply used to govern which actions are available.
</p>


<h2>Cases</h2>

<p>
  A case is the term for a workflow in action. A case always revolves
  around a specific object. and we currently only allow one case for
  one object. That is, you can only have one workflow in process for
  one object.
</p>

<p>
  The case holds information about the current state, the current
  assignments, and an activity log over everything that happens on the
  case.
</p>

</pre>

<pre class="code">
<b>workflow.ActivityLog_FormatTitle</b>
  GetObjectType -> string
  GetPrettyName -> string
  GetTitle (entry_id) -> title
</pre>

<p>
  The <b>GetObjectType</b> method is used for the service contract
  implementation to tell which object types it is valid for. For
  example, a DefaultAssignee implementation can look at a bug, find
  out which component it is found in, then look up the component
  definition to find the default maintainer. This implementation,
  though, is <i>only</i> valid for objects of type 'bt_bugs', or any
  descendants thereof. Thus, this is what the GetObjectType call would
  return for this implementation. If your implementation is valid for
  any ACS Object, then simply return 'acs_object', as this is the
  mother of all objects.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>GetPrettyName</b> method will be run through a localization
  filter, meaning that any occurance of the
  <code>#<i>message-key</i>#</code> notation will be replaced with a
  message catalog lookup for the current domain.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>AssigneeQuery</b> service contract probably needs a little
  explanation. You're supposed to supply a valid subquery, which will
  select the columns party_id, name, email, and screen_name (nulls are
  okay) of all the parties that a role can possibly be assigned to. A
  simple version could simply be "<code>cc_users</code>". Another
  would be:
</p>

<pre class="code">
select u.user_id as party_id, 
       u.first_names || ' ' || u.last_names as name,
       u.email,
       u.screen_name
from   cc_users u
where  (some condition)
</pre>

<p>
  This would then typically be used like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
select distinct 
       q.party_id, 
       q.name || ' (' || u.email || ')' as name_and_email
from   (<b><i>your subquery goes here</i></b>) q
where  upper(coalesce(q.name, '') || 
          q.email || ' ' || 
          coalesce(q.screen_name, '')) 
          like upper('%'||:value||'%')
order  by name_and_email
</pre>

<p>
  Now, one little caveat is that you have to return the query
  dispatcher <b>query name, not the actual query</b>. The query name
  will then get passed to <b>db_map</b> to produce the actual
  subquery.
</p>

<p>
  Workflow will supply these service contract implementations by
  default:

<h2>Notifications</h2>

<p>
  You can sign up for notifications at several levels:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Notify me of all actions to which I'm assigned. You don't have to
    manually go sign up for these notifications, but you should be
    able to change the delivery method and frequency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Notify me of all activity on ...
    <ol>
      <li>
        Any case where I'm assigned to some role.
      </li>
      <li>
        A particular case (one bug-tracker bug)
      </li>
      <li>
        All cases in the particular workflow (entire bug-tracker project)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  You should always receive at most one notification per
  activity. They're sent out in the order in which they're listed
  here, and if you get the first, you won't get the second, third or
  fourth; if you get the second, you won't get the third or fourth,
  etc.
</p>

<p>
  A special case is that the first notification isn't optional. You
  don't have to manually go sign up for those notifications, and you
  can't turn them off entirely. You can still change the delivery
  method and the frequency, though.
</p>

<p>
  In order to implement this, we need to make three fairly trivial
  enhancements to the notifications package.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    We need to be able to pass on the list of already notified users
    from one call of <code>notification::new</code> to the next. So
    <code>notification::new</code> needs to take a parameter like
    <code>-already_notified</code> and to not notify those again, and
    likewise, to return the list of users notified by the given
    notification.
  </li>
  <li>
    We need to be able to limit notifications to only a subset of the
    subscribed base. If you have a subscription on "any case where I'm
    assigned to some role", that's a dynamic relationship. So the call
    to <code>notification::new</code> would take as a parameter the
    list of people who are assigned to some role on this particular
    case. Only people who are subscribed <i>and</i> on that list will
    get notified. I can't think of a good name for such a parameter,
    perhaps <code>-positive_list</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, we need to force people on the positive list above to get
    notifications even though they don't currently have a
    subscription. This could be a <code>-force:boolean</code>
    parameter which works in conjunction with the positive list, so
    that people on the positive list who aren't subscribers get a
    default email/instant subscription automatically. They can then go
    back and change their delivery method and frequency later.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>API for Defining Workflows</h3>

<p>

<h3>API for the Form Page</h3>

<p>
  The intended user interface for a workflow-based application is
  similar to the bug-tracker. The form is shown in display-only mode,
  with buttons corresponding to actions along the bottom
  (e.g. Comment, Edit, Resolve, Close).
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>case::get_case_id(object_id, short_name) -> case_id</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Find the case_id from object_id and workflow short_name.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>case::get_user_roles(case_id, user_id) -> { list of roles }</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Find out which roles the current user has wrt the current object.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>case::get_enabled_actions(case_id, user_id) -> { list of { label name } }</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The actions currently enabled in this state.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>case::get_user_actions(case_id, user_id) -> { list of { label name } }</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The enabled actions which the current user has permission to
      perform.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>case::action::get_editable_fields(case_id, action) -> { list of field names }</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Which fields should we edit, depending on the current
      action. NOTE! We probably won't be able to support this in the
      first version.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>case::state::get_hidden_fields(case_id) -> { list of field names }</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Which fields should we hide, depending on the state. NOTE! We
      probably won't be able to support this in the first version.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>case::action::available_p(case_id, user_id, action_id) -> (boolean)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Is this action enabled and allowed for this user?
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>case::action::new_state(case_id, action_id) -> (state_id)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The new state which the case will have after this action has
      been performed (if action doesn't change state, returns the
      current state again.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>case::action::execute(case_id, action_id, comment, comment_format) -> (state_id)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Perform the action, updating the workflow state, etc. This
      should be called from inside a db_transaction where the case
      object has just been updated.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Here's what the form page would look like:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ad_page_contract { ... } {
    bug_id:integer,notnull  
}

# Setup return_url, user_id, etc.
...

# Current action, blank for display mode
set action [form get_action bug]

# Check permissions
workflow::case::require_permission -object_id $bug_id -action $action

# Create the form
form create bug \
    -mode display \
    -actions [workflow::case::get_actions -object_id $object_id -action $action] \
    -cancel_url $return_url

element create ...

# Valid submission: Update
if { [form is_valid bug] } {
    bug_tracker::bug::edit \
        -bug_id $bug_id \
        ...

    ad_returnredirect $return_url
    ad_script_abort
}

# Non-valid submission: Either request or error form
if { ![form is_valid bug] } {
    bug_tracker::bug::get -bug_id $bug_id -array bug

    set bug(status) [workflow::action::new_state -object_id $object_id -action $action]

    # Hide elements that should be hidden
    foreach element [workflow::state::get_hidden_fields -object_id $object_id] {
        element set_properties bug $element -widget hidden
    }
    
    # Set element values
    ...
    # - if [form is_request] then set all
    # - otherwise only set elements in display-mode  

    # Page title, context bar, filters, etc.
    ...
}
</pre>

<h2>Future Extensions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Implement metadata spec and integrate with that so you can pick
    which fields in your form to view/edit/hide depending on state and
    action.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Nice-to-haves that aren't <i>entirely</i> pie-in-the-sky include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    User interface components that can generate a user interface like
    bug-tracker's, i.e. buttons below the form showing the actions
    that you can take, the resolution entries, the sub-status codes,
    etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pluggable models, for example, finite-state machines, petri-nets,
    dependency graphs. A service-contract-based interface allows you
    to plug in a new model.
  </li>
  <li>
    Integration with a task-list application to maintain the user's
    one task list (synchronization with Palm, etc.).
  </li>
  <li>
    Integration with calendar, so deadlines show up there.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Appendix A. Pluggable Models</h2>

<p>
  I've looked into pluggable models before, and it's not too
  complicated. The trick is that you have four areas where the generic
  workflow framework/engine will interface with the plugin model:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    All workflow models have some definition of 'state'. For finite
    state machines, it's simply the name of the state, you're
    currently in: The structure here is a value from an enumeration. A
    petri net has as its state a list of tokens, each of which is
    currently in a particular place. A dependency graph model has as
    its state the list of tasks that have been completed. The workflow
    engine must provide an API for the pluggable model to access,
    manipulate, and store its state, but need not know anything about
    the internals of the state or how it's manipulated.
  </li>
  <li>
    All workflow models has some elements that go into its workflow
    specification: FSMs have states and transitions; a transition is
    an arc from one state to another. Petri nets have places and
    transitions, and it has arcs that point from a place to a
    transition, or a transition to a state. Dependency graphcs has
    tasks and dependencies, where a depency goes from one task to
    another task.
  </li>
  <li>
    All workflow models has some concept of actions (tasks,
    transitions). An action has some precondition for when it's
    enabled, i.e., for when a user can or should perform this
    action. This is a function of the state. And actions also cause a
    well-defined change to the state, i.e., we move to a different
    state, tokens are consumed from some places and produced on
    others, etc. This is a function of the state, and also produces a
    new state.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are the interaction points between a generic workflow engine,
  and its specific model implementations.
</p>

<h2>Appendix B. Fix or Rewrite</h2>

<p>
  Should we discard workflow and rewrite, or should we try to
  incrementally improve what's there?
</p>

<p>
  In general, you should be weary of rewriting if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You have many users of your software who'll want to upgrade,
    because they'll be annoyed by small changes to how things work.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have a different set of people implementing it the second time
    than you had the first time.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Neither of these are the case here. We don't have any significant
  users of workflow, and we have access to the same people (person)
  who did the original implementation to implement it again.
</p>

<p>
  Besides, the planned changes are so big that there would be no code
  left untouched.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Switch to FSMs instead of Petri Nets, which obliviates the engine
    and most of the admin UI
  </li>
  <li>
    Discard Graphviz for admin UI
  </li>
  <li>
    Current UI not using form builder/ad_form
  </li>
  <li>
    Current data model not using acs-kernel properly, e.g., a new
    workflow is an object type.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Hence, we've concluded that a rewrite is in fact the most productive
  strategy.
</p>
