<h1>Package Developer's Guide to Workflow</h1>

  By <a href="http://www.pinds.com">Lars Pind</a>
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  The workflow package manages a collaborative process surrounding
  some object.
</p>

<p>
   Examples of the object could be a bug in a bug tracker,
  a ticket in a ticket tracker, a content item in a content management
  system, a user contribution in a moderated forum/comments/whatever
  application, a user's request for particpation in a
  course/event/whatever.
</p>

<p> For example, when a new bug is submitted, someone's assigned to
fix it, and whoever submitted it is assigned to verify the fix and
close the bug. Once the bug's fixed, the submitter will get notified,
and the bug will wait in the 'resolved' state until the submitter has
verified and then closed the bug. </p

<p> In order to make use of workflow in your own application, here are
the things you need to consider: </p>

<ol>

  <li> Define your default process. The idea typically is to allow
  your end users to modify the process to suit their needs, but you'll
  want eto provide a process which they can use as a starting point.
  </li>

  <li> Identify, declare, and implement the callbacks that your
  application will need.  </li>

  <li> Write the code to set up the initial process, and to clone that
  process for each package instance.  </li>

  <li> Integrate workflow support into your application's API.  </li>

  <li> Integrate workflow support into your application's user
  interface.  </li>

  <li> Integrate workflow into your application's queries </li>

</ol>

<p> Let's first look at some concepts before getting into the
technicalities of how you actually do this. For a working example of
building workflow-based applications, we recommend you take a look at
bug-tracker. </p>

<h2>Workflow Concepts</h2>

<h3>What's in a workflow</h3>

<p>
  In its broadest, most conceptual sense, a workflow is defined as
  (and this does get a little hairy, so feel free to skip if you just
  want to start developing your applicaton):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A number of <b>actions</b> that can
    be executed (open, edit, comment, resolve, edit, publish, approve,
    reject, etc.) Whether or not an action is <b>enabled</b>, meaning
    it can be executed at this point in time, will depend on the
    current <b>state</b> of the workflow. Executing an action may
    <b>change the state</b> of the workflow.
  </li>
  <li>
    A definition of the possible <b>states</b> that the
    workflow can be in. This could simply be an enumeration of states,
    such as "Open", "Resolved", "Closed", in which case we're talking
    about a "Finite State Machine" (because there's a finite number of
    possible states). Other models, such as petri nets, have an
    infinite number of possible states. This makes things a lot more
    complicated, and you don't need to bother since this first
    implementation of workflow only supports finite state machines.
  </li>
  <li>
    People participate in a workflow through their <b>role</b>. For a
    bug tracker, the roles could be "Submitter", "Resolver", and
    "Tester". For a publication workflow, they'd be "Author", "Editor",
    and "Publisher". Actions will be to roles, which in turn will be
    linked to users or groups of users in a particular workflow
    case. The reason we link people to actions through the concept of
    roles is to allow you to specify that two or more actions should
    be done by the same party. In bug-tracker, for example, the same
    user who opened the bug should also close it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Finite State Machines (FSMs)</h3>

<p>
  As mentioned, workflow is designed to support workflows based on any
  model, however the only model currently implemented is the finite
  state machine.
</p>

<p>
  The workflow API is designed so that whenver you're using features
  that are specific to finite state machines, the procedure name will
  include the letters "fsm" in the name, as in <code><a
  href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::fsm::get">workflow::case::fsm::get</a></code>. That
  way you'll know when you're hard-wiring a dependency on the
  particular workflow model.
</p>

<p>
  It's considered good practice to only use non-fsm API calls, but in
  practice, it can be hard to create good user experiences without. So
  feel free.
</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <b>Notation:</b>
  <p style="margin-left: 24px;">
    [Action] (State) {Role}
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 24px;">
    (State1) -> [Action1] -> (State2) -> [Action2] -> (State3)
  </p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Cases</h3>

<p>
  So much for defining the workflow. When you start "running" your
  workflow, that's called a <b>workflow case</b>, or simply a
  case. A case is concerned with a particular object, it's always in a
  particular state, and it has specific people or groups assigned to
  its different roles.
</p>

<h3>In-flow and out-of-flow</h3>

<p>
  When defining actions, we differentiate between <b>in-flow and
  out-of-flow</b>. In-flow refers to the normal idealized flow of the
  workflow, out-of-flow are the rest. Concretely what it means is that
  if you're assigned to an in-flow action, we'll bug you about it
  through notifications, and potentially get mad at you if you don't
  come and do something to get the workflow moving along. We don't do
  that with out-of-flow actions. So we'll send a notification that
  says "Please come back and resolve this bug", whereas we'll not
  notify everybody who are allowed to comment saying "Please come back
  and comment on this bug".
</p>

<p>
  For bug-tracker, the normal flow (in-flow) is this:
</p>

<blockquote>
  (Open) -> [Resolve] -> (Resolved) -> [Close] -> (Closed)
</blockquote>

<p>
  Other actions not in the normal flow are [Edit] and [Comment], which
  are always enabled, but never change the state. And [Reopen] which
  throw you back to the (Open) state. And finally [Resolved] is
  in-flow when in the (Open) state, but out-of-flow when in the
  (Resolved) state, meaning that you can re-resolve a bug if you need
  to, but you're not required to.
</p>

<p>
  In-flow and out-of-flow depends on the action, the state, and the
  user's role in the case. For example, it might be that users in the
  {Submitter} role are allowed to resolve their own bugs, but the
  [Resolve] action will still only be considered in-flow to people in
  the {Assignee} or {Resolver} role.
</p>

<h2>The Six Steps Conceptually</h2>

<p>
  The recommended way a workflow is linked to an application is this:
  As part of developing your application, you define your <b>default
  workflow</b>, which will be used as a template for customization by the
  users of your applications. This workflow will be installed using
  the APM after-install callback, and will be linked to your
  application's package-key.
</p>

<p>
  Then when a new instance of your application is created, your
  <b>default workflow will be cloned</b>, and the clone linked to the
  new instance, so that your users can customize the workflow for each
  instance of your application individually. The default copy
  installed along with your package is never actually used except for
  cloning when creating a new instance. This means that your users can
  customize this deafult workflow, and the modified version will serve
  as the boilerplate for all new package instances.
</p>

<p>
  In order to integrate workflow with your application, you'll want to
  implement one or more of the <b>callback service
  contracts</b>. These can do things like determine default assignees
  based on certain data in your application, get information about
  your application's object for use when sending out notifications, or
  perform side-effects, such as actually changing the publication
  state of a content item when you execute the [Publish] action.
</p>

<p>
  When integrating the workflow with your application's user
  experience, what workflow will give you is essentially the <b>list of
  actions</b> that the given user can perform on the given object at the
  given time. In bug-tracker, for example, bug-tracker takes care of
  displaying the form displaying and editing a bug, while workflow
  takes care of displaying the buttons that say [Comment], [Edit],
  [Resolve], [Reopen], [Close], etc., along the bottom of the
  form. Workflow also has a place to store which form elements should
  be opened for editing depending on the action being executed.
</p>

<p>
  Your application should typically have an API for creating a new
  object, editing an object, etc. This <b>application object API will
  need to be workflow-aware</b>, so when a new object is created, a
  new workflow case will be started as well. And when the object's
  edited, that should generally only happen through a workflow action,
  so that needs to be taken into account as well.
</p>

<p>
  The final step is integrating workflow into your application's
  queries when you want to <b>filter an object listing/count based on
  the workflow state</b>. This is the only place where you'll directly
  be dependent on the workflow data model.
</p>


<h2>Defining Your Process (FSM)</h2>

<p>
  The current version of workflow only supports workflows based on a
  finite state machine (FSM). Support for other models, such as petri
  nets and directed graphs are possible, but not currently designed or
  implemented.
</p>

<p>
  An FSM-based workflow consists of a set of states, actions, and roles.
</p>

<p>
  You define a new workflow like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
set spec {
    <i>workflow-short-name</i> {
        ...
        roles {
            <i>role-short-name</i> {
               ...
            }
            ...
        }
        states {
            <i>state-short-name</i> {
               ...
            }
            ...
        }
        actions {
            <i>action-short-name</i> {
               ...
            }
            ...
        }
    }
}

set workflow_id [<a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::fsm::new_from_spec">workflow::fsm::new_from_spec</a> -spec $spec]
</pre>

<p>
  All the items (workflow, roles, states, actions) have a short-name,
  which should be lowercase and use underbar (_) instead of
  spaces. These are mainly used to refer to the items in other parts
  of the spec.
</p>

<p>
  The workflow short name can be used to refer to the
  workflow in your application, which is useful if you have several
  different workflows. The bug-tracker, for example, could have a
  workflow for bugs and another one for patches.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, you can also refer states, roles, and actions in your
  application using short names, although this creates a dependency in
  your application on a particular form of the workflow, and there's
  currently no mechanism for ensuring that your workflow contains the
  states, roles, and actions you'd refer to. This is on the todo-list.
</p>

<h3>Workflow</h3>

<p>
  These are the attributes you can specify for the workflow itself:
</p>

<table cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" class="header">Workflow Attributes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="white">
    <td><code>pretty_name</code></td>
    <td>
      Name used in the user interface.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>package_key</code></td>
    <td>
      The package that defined this workflow.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>object_type</code></td>
    <td>
      The parent object type which this workflow can be applied
      to. If your workflow applies to any object, say 'acs_object'. 
      This is used in relation to callbacks when we build 
      the user interface for defining workflows. More on this in the
      section on callbacks.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callbacks</code></td>
    <td>
      Callbacks that apply to the whole workflow. If you add
      side-effect callbacks, these are executed every time any action
      is executed.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>roles</code></td>
    <td>
      Denotes the section of the spec that defines the workflow's roles.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>states</code></td>
    <td>
      Denotes the section of the spec that defines the workflow's states.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>actions</code></td>
    <td>
      Denotes the section of the spec that defines the workflow's actions.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<blockquote class="note">
  <b>Internationalization Note:</b>
  <p style="margin-left: 24px;">
    When we make workflow internationalized for OpenACS 5.0, pretty
    names will contain message keys in the form
    "#<i>message-key</i>#". More about this in the package developer's
    guide to internationalization.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Roles</h3>

<p>
  Attributes for roles:
</p>

<table cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" class="header">Role Attributes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>pretty_name</code></td>
    <td>
      Name used in the user interface.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callbacks</code></td>
    <td>
      Callbacks that define how assignment of this role to users is done.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h3>States</h3>

<p>
  A few typical examples of states:
</p>

<table cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" class="header">Examples of States</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Application</th>
    <th>States</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ticket Tracker</td>
    <td>
      (Open),(Completed), and (Closed)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bug Tracker</td>
    <td>
      (Open), (Triaged), (Resolved), and (Closed)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Content Management System Publication</td>
    <td>
      (Authored), (Edited), and (Published)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Simple Approval</td>
    <td>
      (Requested), (Approved), and (Rejected)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  These are the state attributes in the workflow specification:
</p>

<table cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" class="header">State Attributes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>pretty_name</code></td>
    <td>
      Name used in the user interface.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>hide_fields</code></td>
    <td>
      A tcl list of form elements/object attributes that don't make
      sense in this state. In bug-tracker, the element "Fixed in
      version" doesn't make sense when the bug is (Open), and thus not
      yet fixed. It's currently up to your application to do
      incorporate this into your application.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>
  Actions are what the workflow allows you to do to your object.
</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <b>Terminology:</b>
  <dl style="margin-left: 24px;">
    <dt>Enabled</dt>
    <dd>
      The action is allowed to be executed in the workflow's current state.
    </dd>
    <dt>Allowed</dt>
    <dd>
      The given user is allowed to execute the action given his
      current relationship to the workflow case and the object.
    </dd>
    <dt>Assigned</dt>
    <dd>
      The same as allowed, but the action is in-flow for this user.
    </dd>
    <dt>Available</dt>
    <dd>
      The action is both enabled and allowed for this user.
    </dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Some actions will <b>always be enabled</b>. In bug-tracker, for
  example, we have [Comment] and [Edit] actions, which are always
  allowed, regardless of whether the bug is (Open), (Resolved), or
  (Closed).
</p>

<p>
  Other actions, however, will only be <b>enabled in certain
  states</b>. In bug-tracker, for example, the [Close] action is only
  available in the (Resolved) state.
</p>

<p>
  Another distinction is that <b>some actions change the state, and
  others do not</b>. [Comment] and [Edit], for example, do
  not. [Resolve], [Close], and [Reopen] do. For an FSM, when an action
  changes the state, you simply specify what the new state should be.
</p>

<p>
  There's a special action called the <b>initial action</b>. This is
  implicitly executed when a new case is started for this workflow,
  and must always specify the "new_state" attribute to define which
  state new cases start out in.
</p>

<p>
  Attributes for actions:
</p>

<table cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" class="header">Action Attributes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>pretty_name</code></td>
    <td>
      Name used in the user interface.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>pretty_past_tense</code></td>
    <td>
      This is used in the case log to say "&lt;pretty_past_teense&gt;
      by &lt;user&gt; on &lt;date&gt;", for example "Resolved by Jeff
      Davis on April 15, 2003".
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>new_state</code></td>
    <td>
      The short_name of the state this action puts the case
      into. Leave out if the action shouldn't change the state.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>initial_action_p</code></td>
    <td>
      Say 't' if this is the initial action. Leave out or set to 'f' otherwise.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>allowed_roles</code></td>
    <td>
      A list of roles that are allowed but not assigned to perform this action.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>assigned_role</code></td>
    <td>
      A single role which is assigned to this action.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>privileges</code></td>
    <td>
      A list of privileges. Users who have been granted one of these
      privileges on the case's object will be allowed to execute this action.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>always_enabled_p</code></td>
    <td>
      Say 't' if this action should be enabled regardless of the
      case's current state. Say 'f' or leave out otherwise.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>enabled_states</code></td>
    <td>
      If not always enabled, enumerate the states in which this action
      is enabled <i>but not</i> assigned.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>assigned_states</code></td>
    <td>
      Enumerate the states in which this action
      is enabled <i>and</i> assigned.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>edit_fields</code></td>
    <td>
      A tcl list of fields which should be opened for editing when the
      user is performing this action. Again, it's up to the application
      to act on this.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callbacks</code></td>
    <td>
      Side-effect callbacks which are executed when this action is executed.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Putting A Workflow Together</h3>

<p>
  When you put this all together, here's a real live example of what
  defining a workflow could look like:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ad_proc -private bug_tracker::bug::workflow_create {} {
    Create the 'bug' workflow for bug-tracker
} {
    set spec {
        bug {
            pretty_name "Bug"
            package_key "bug-tracker"
            object_type "bt_bug"
            callbacks { 
                bug-tracker.FormatLogTitle 
                bug-tracker.BugNotificationInfo
            }
            roles {
                submitter {
                    pretty_name "Submitter"
                    callbacks { 
                        workflow.Role_DefaultAssignees_CreationUser
                    }
                }
                assignee {
                    pretty_name "Assignee"
                    callbacks {
                        bug-tracker.ComponentMaintainer
                        bug-tracker.ProjectMaintainer
                        workflow.Role_PickList_CurrentAssignees
                        workflow.Role_AssigneeSubquery_RegisteredUsers
                    }
                }
            }
            states {
                open {
                    pretty_name "Open"
                    hide_fields { resolution fixed_in_version }
                }
                resolved {
                    pretty_name "Resolved"
                }
                closed {
                    pretty_name "Closed"
                }
            }
            actions {
                open {
                    pretty_name "Open"
                    pretty_past_tense "Opened"
                    new_state "open"
                    initial_action_p t

                    always_enabled_p t
                }
                edit {
                    pretty_name "Edit"
                    pretty_past_tense "Edited"

<h2>Defining Callbacks</h2>

<p>
  There are a number of different types of callbacks, each of which applies to
  different workflow items (workflows, roles, states, actions). They're all
  defined as service contracts.
</p>

<p>
  In order to make use of them, your application will need to
  implement these service contracts, and register the implementation
  with the relevant workflow item through the 'callbacks' attribute in
  the spec above.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the types of callbacks defined, how they're used, and the
  workflow items they apply to.
</p>

<table cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="3" class="header">Service contracts</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Service Contract</th>
    <th>Applies To</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Workflow.Role_DefaultAssignees</code></td>
    <td>
      Roles
    </td>
    <td>
      Used to get the default assignees for a role. Called for all
      roles when a case is started. Also called for roles with no
      assignees, when that role is assigned to an action. Should return a
      list of party_id's.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Workflow.Role_AssigneePickList</code></td>
    <td>
      Roles
    </td>
    <td>
      Used when the users wants to reassign a role to populate a
      drop-down list of the most likely users/groups to assign this role
      to. Should return less than 25 users/groups. Should return a
      list of party_id's.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Workflow.Role_AssigneeSubQuery</code></td>
    <td>
      Roles
    </td>
    <td>
      A subquery used to limit the scope of the user's search for a
      new assignee for a role. Could typically be used to limit the
      search to members of a particular group, organizers of a
      particular event, etc.
      <p>
      Should return a subquery ready to be
      included in the from-clause of a query, which will be used when
      querying for users, for example '(select * from parties where
      ...)', (sub-selects must be in parenthesis), or simply
      'cc_users' or 'parties'. Defaults to 'cc_users'.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Workflow.Action_SideEffect</code></td>
    <td>
      Workflows, Actions
    </td>
    <td>
      This is executed whenever the given action is executed. If
      specified for the workflow, it will be executed whenever any
      action is executed on the workflow. For details about how to use
      this in conjunction with log entry data and format log title,
      see below.
      <p>
      Side-effects are executed after the application object has been
      updated, after the workflow state has been changed, after the
      log entry has been crated, and roles assigned, but before
      notifications have been sent out.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Workflow.ActivityLog_FormatTitle</code></td>
    <td>
      Workflows
    </td>
    <td>
      Used to format the title of the case log. In bug-tracker, this
      is used to get the resolution code displayed in the case log as
      "Resolved (Fixed)" or "Resolved (Not Reproducable)".
      <p>
      The implementation should return the text string that should go
      into the parenthesis. The parenthesis are automatically added 
      if the returned string is non-empty.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Workflow.NotificationInfo</code></td>
    <td>
      Workflows
    </td>
    <td>
      Allows the application to supply information about the case
      object for the notification.
      <p>

      Should return the notification information as a 4-element list
      containing: 
      <ol>
        <li>url
        <li>one-line summary
        <li>details about the object in
            the form of an array-list with label/value
        <li>tag for the notification subject (optional). If present,
            it will be put inside brackets [].
      </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  All the service contracts have 3 operations each. The first two are
  the same for all service contracts, and they really just act like
  static variables:
</p>

<table cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4" class="header">Common service contract operations</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Operation</th>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GetObjectType</td>
    <td>
      <i>None</i>
    </td>
    <td>
      object_type:string
    </td>
    <td>
      Get the object type for which this implementation is valid. If
      your implementation is valid for any object, return
      'acs_object', otherwise return the object type.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GetPrettyName</td>
    <td>
      <i>None</i>
    </td>
    <td>
      pretty_name:string
    </td>
    <td>
      Get the pretty name of this implementation. This will be used in
      the user interface to let the workflow designer pick which
      implementation to use.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The third operation is the one that does the real work. Here are the
  inputs and outputs:

<p>
  For the most up-to-date information about the service contracts,
  your safest bet is to refer to the user-visible pages of the
  acs-service-contract package itself, which will let you view your
  currently installed contracts and implementations.
</p>

<h3>Log Entry Data and Log Entry Titles</h3>

<p>
  One noteworthy thing that side-effects can be used for, is to
  record information about a log entry for use later in displaying a
  more detailed log entry title, or can be used to e.g. tie a workflow
  log entry to a particular content repository revision, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Using <a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::add_log_data">workflow::case::add_log_data</a>, you can add arbitrary key/value
  pairs to a log entry. These can the be retrieved later using
  <a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::get_log_data_by_key">workflow::case::get_log_data_by_key</a>, and <a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::get_log_data">workflow::case::get_log_data</a>.
</p>


<h2>Installing and Instantiating (APM Tcl Callbacks)</h2>

<p>
  Here are the workflow-related operations that you'll typically want
  your application to do from the APM Tcl Callbacks:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>after-install</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Register service contract implementations
      <li>Create default workflow (<code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::fsm::new_from_spec">workflow::fsm::new_from_spec</a></code>)
    </ul>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>before-uninstall</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete default workflow (<code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::delete">workflow::delete</a></code>)
      <li>Unregister service contract implementations
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>before-upgrade</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new service contract implementations
      <li>Add new workflows
      <li>Make changes to existing default workflows (if the installed
  verison is not modified) (this isn't yet supported on the workflow API)
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>after-instantiate</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Clone default workflow to create a new workflow attached to
        the instance (<code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::fsm::clone">workflow::fsm::clone</a></code>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>before-uninstantiate</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Delete the workflow attached to the instance (<code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::delete">workflow::delete</a></code>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  To see what this could look like in practice, check out
  <code>packages/bug-tracker/tcl/install-procs.tcl</code>.
</p>


<h2>Integrating With Your Application's API</h2>

<p>
  Newer applications will define a namespace for each of the objects
  it defines, which will contain procs like "get", "new", "delete",
  etc., to manipulate these objects.
</p>

<p>
  Given such a setup, here are the procs that you want to integrate
  workflow into for your workflow-integrated objects. For a real-life 
  example, see <code>packages/bug-tracker/tcl/bug-procs.tcl</code> and
  search for "workflow::".
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>get</dt>
  <dd>
    In addition to your application's object data, you'll want to call
    <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::get_id">workflow::case::get_id</a></code> to get the case_id for your
    object, and then either <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::get">workflow::case::get</a></code> or
    <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::fsm::get">workflow::case::fsm::get</a></code> in order to get state
    information from workflow to include in the data set returned by
    your API proc.
  </dd>

  <dt>new</dt>
  <dd>
    When creating a new object, you should also start a new workflow
    case for that object using <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::new">workflow::case::new</a></code>.
  </dd>

  <dt>edit</dt>
  <dd>
    Editing an object should only happen through a workflow action, if
    you want to have a complete audit log (workflow case log). Thus,
    your edit proc should take the following arguments, in addition to
    the object_id and the array containing the object data:
    <pre>
      -action_id:required
      -comment:required
      -comment_format:required
      {-entry_id {}}
    </pre>
    (entry_id is for double-click protection).
    <p>
    First, you should update your application object data as normal.
    Then you'll probably want to use
    <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::get_id">workflow::case::get_id</a></code> to find the case_id. If you
    have assignment integrated in your form, you'll want to call 
    <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::role::assign">workflow::case::role::assign</a></code> to pass these on to
    workflow, and finally you'll say 
    <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::action::execute">workflow::case::action::execute</a></code> to execute the
    action, including state changes, side-effects, and notifications.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Integrating With Your Application's User Interface</h2> 

<p>
  Usually, you'll want one page that lists all the objects in your
  package instance, and another that lets the user view/edit one
  object, called the object form page. This section is about the
  object form page, the next section is about the object listing page.
</p>

<p>
  For a real-life example, look at
  <code>packages/bug-tracker/www/bug.tcl</code>. You may want to have
  that handy while reading through this.
</p>

<p>
  We're hoping to make some streamlining of both ad_form and workflow
  to make this form page integration even easier at some point. But no promises.
</p>

<p>
  Use <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::get_id">workflow::case::get_id</a></code> to get the case_id.
</p>

<p>
  If you want buttons along the bottom of the form like bug-tracker,
  use the new 'action' feature of the form builder. What you do is
  pass a list of possible actions to the form builder as a
  list-of-lists with { label value }. These will be
  displayed as buttons at the bottom of the form.
</p>

<p>
  When one of these buttons are clicked, the form will be in
  edit-mode, and you can use <code>form get_action</code> to get the
  value of the action chosen.
</p>

<p>
  So up top, you'll want to ask the form if an action is in progress,
  and which one it is, by saying <code>set action_id [form get_action
  <i>form-id</i>]</code>. If no action is in progress this will return
  the empty string.
</p>

<p>
  Then you should check that this action is currently available to
  this user by saying
  <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::action::available_p">workflow::case::action::available_p</a></code>.
</p>

<p>
  To get the currently available actions so you can offer them to the
  user, use <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::get_available_actions">workflow::case::get_available_actions</a></code> which
  will return the action_id's, then <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::action::get">workflow::action::get</a></code>
  to get the details about each of the actions.
</p>

<p>
  If you're using <code>ad_form</code>, and you want only one assignee
  per role, and you want assignment integrated with your form, use
  <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::role::add_assignee_widgets">workflow::case::role::add_assignee_widgets</a></code> to add the
  widgets. It'll do an <code>ad_form -extend</code>, so they'll appear
  at the point at which you call this proc.
</p>

<p>
  To set the editable fields as defined for the action, do this:
</p>

<pre>
if { ![empty_string_p $action_id] } {
    foreach field [<a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::action::get_element">workflow::action::get_element</a> -action_id $action_id -element edit_fields] { 
	element set_properties bug $field -mode edit 
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
  Similarly, on submit, you'll want to set the value of the editable fields.
</p>

<p>
  To populate values of the assignee widgets, use
  <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::role::set_assignee_values">workflow::case::role::set_assignee_values</a></code> in your
  <code>on_request</code> block.
</p>

<p>
  To add the case log to the comment field, use
  <code><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=workflow::case::get_activity_html">workflow::case::get_activity_html</a></code> and feed it to the
  <code>before_html</code> property of a textarea.
</p>


<h2>Integrating With Your Application's Queries</h2>

<p>
  Here's an example of how the bug-tracker integrates with workflow
  for nformation about the current state of bugs.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
select b.bug_id,
       ...

       st.pretty_name as pretty_state,
       st.short_name as state_short_name,
       st.state_id,
       st.hide_fields,

       assignee.party_id as assignee_party_id,
       assignee.email as assignee_email,
       assignee.name as assignee_name

from   bt_bugs b,
       workflow_cases cas left outer join
       (select rpm.case_id,
               p.party_id,
               p.email,
               acs_object__name(p.party_id) as name
          from workflow_case_role_party_map rpm,
               parties p
         where rpm.role_id = :action_role
           and p.party_id = rpm.party_id
         ) assignee on (cas.case_id = assignee.case_id),
       workflow_case_fsm cfsm,
       workflow_fsm_states st 
where  cas.workflow_id = :workflow_id
and    cas.object_id = b.bug_id
and    cfsm.case_id = cas.case_id
and    st.state_id = cfsm.current_state
and    b.project_id = :package_id
order  by $order_by_clause
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  Note the outer join to get the assignee(s). The joins to get
  information about the current state is straight-forward.
</p>

<h2>Good Luck!</h2>

<p>
  That's all I think you'll need to know to start developing
  workflow-enabled applications.
