<p>
  The workflow package provides a service to keep track of a process
  involving multiple people around some object. Workflow keeps track
  of the process you wish to follow, of where you currently are in the
  process (the current state), and who's supposed to do what.

    This is the document we wrote before implementing workflow specifying
     how we intended to implement the package then. It is inaccurate in a 
     number of places where reality forced us to make changes.

    Adding actions as sub-workflows, automatic/timed actions, more conditions before actions are
    enabled, dynamic outcome of actions, resolution codes.

<h2>Version History</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>1.0d4</b> Resolved conflicts with old acs-workflow package, so they install side by side. (May 11, 2003)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>1.0d3</b> Added Tcl API workflow::case::delete ;
    fixed bug in PL/SQL implementation of workflow_case.delete/workflow_case__delete ;
    added @see to workflow::case::insert.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>1.0d2</b> Completed package developer's guide. Added -action_id
  switch to workflow::case::get_activity_html.  </li>

  <li>
    <b>1.0d1</b> Bumped up the version number to 1.0 to reflect the
    fact that this package is actually at a steady state and fully
    useful as is. Also added a little API and cleaned up things a bit,
    the kind of things you learn while writing the documentation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>0.2d2</b> First version released along with OpenACS 4.6.2.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Todo</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Internationalization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add  API for modifying live workflows, including ensuring that the modifications are
    always safe (i.e. you can't delete a state that's used.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a user interface for defining workflows.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a user interface for monitoring workflows and bulk changing
    the state of workflows.
  </li>
  <li>
    Periodically notify people of their outstanding assigned actions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a task list user interface, either as part of the Workflow package, or as a separate pacakge.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add support for petri nets and other models.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add timing of actions, deadlines, and integrate those with calendar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Application integration with certain states and actions. For
    example, in bug-tracker, we treat the "Open" and "Closed" states
    specially. We also treat the "Resolve" action specially. Should be
    possible to define this link.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add workflow variants, so you can ship your application with
    multiple default implementations of the same workflow and let the
    user choose between the available variants (e.g. simple approval
    vs. multiple approval variants, choice of triage and Q&amp;A steps in
    the bug-tracker, etc.). This should probably be tied to some
    concept of an 'application' as in the bullet above.
  </li>
</ul>
