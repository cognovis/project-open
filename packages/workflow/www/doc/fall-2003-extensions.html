<p>
  This requirements and design document is primarily motivated by:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A client project developing the Simulation pacakge (in CVS at
    openacs.org:/cvsroot openacs-4/contrib/packages/simulation), which
    is a workflow-based law simulation engine.
  </li>
  <li>
    The need for an application that can handle the TIP voting
    process.

<h2><a name="hierarchy">Hierarchical Workflows</a></h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  Use cases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Leiden: We have several occurances of the simple AskInfo-GiveInfo
    question/response pair. Defining simulation templates would be
    simplified if that was a reusable component.
  </li>
  <li>
    TIP Voting: There's a master workflow case for the TIP
    itself. When voting, there'll be a sub-workflow case for each TIP
    member to vote on the issue, with timeouts so if they don't vote
    within a week, their vote is automatically 'Abstained'.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions we need answered by the design</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Which actions are enabled?
  </li>
  <li>
    How is the state changed after this action has executed?
  </lI>
  <li>
    Which roles are assigned/allowed to perform an action?
  </li>
  <li>
    Which roles do a user play?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is the activity history on this case?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is the name of this action?
  </li>
  <li>
    How do we clone a workflow?
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Design</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Actions will no longer be atomic. An action can be "in progress"
    for a long time, while the child workflow(s) completes.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will introduce an uber-state of a case, which can be 'active',
    'completed', 'canceled', or 'suspended'.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the action gets enabled, a callback will create child cases
    linked to this particular enabled action.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whenever a child case changes its case_state, a callback on the
    parent action is invoked, which examines the state of all of its
    child cases and determines whether the parent action is complete
    and ready to fire or not. If the parent action is completed, any
    remaining 'active' child cases will be marked 'canceled'.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the action should ever get un-enabled, a callback will cancel
    all remaining 'active' child cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the action becomes enabled again, we will create new child
    cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    A case which is a child of another case cannot leave the
    'completed' or 'canceled' state, unless its parent enabled action
    is still enabled.
  </li>
</ul>

);
</pre>

<h4>Enabled States Explained</h4>

<p>
  The enabled_state of rows in workflow_case_enabled_actions can be in one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Enabled</b>. The action is currently enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Running</b>. The action is currently running, specifically
    meaning that there are active child cases.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXX do we need this?

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Completed</b>. The action has completed executing. The row will
    still stay around so we have a history of what was executed when and
    we're able to count the number of times a given action was executed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Canceled</b>. The action was enabled, but the case's state
    changed before the action was triggered. (Note: This is not
    necessary, we could just delete the row instead.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Refused</b>. The action had its database-driven preconditions
    for being enabled met (e.g. enabled-in-states for FSM, input
    places with tokens in Petri, plus dependencies on other tasks
    met), but the "CanEnableP" callback refused to let the action
    become enabled. (Note: This is not necessary, we could just
    delete the row instead.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>When Enabled</h4>

<p>
  When an action with child workflows is enabled, we start the child
  cases defined by the parent workflow, executing the initial action
  on each of them.
</p>

<p>
  We create one case per role in workflow_action_children times one
  case per member/user for roles with a mapping_type of
  'per_member'/'per_user'. If more than one role has a mapping_type other
  than 'per_role', we will create cases for the cartesian product of
  members/users of those roles in the parent workflow.
</p>

<h4>When Triggered</h4>

<p>
  The action can be triggered by a timeout, by the user, by child
  cases reaching a certain state, or by all child cases being
  completed.
</p>

<p>
  An example of "child cases reaching a certain state" would be the
  TIP voting process, where 2/3rd Approved votes is enough to
  determine the outcome, and we don't need the rest to vote anymore.
</p>


<p>
  When triggered, all child cases with a case_state of 'active' are
  put into the 'canceled' state. All child cases have their 'locked_p'
  flag set to true, so they cannot be reopened.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Keeping the sub-state in the workflow_case_enabled_actions table.
  </li>
  <li>
    Kill the completed rows in workflow_case_enabled_actions, move
    stuff into the case-log instead => that's going to be much, much
    better for performance.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Difference between parallel sub-actions and non-parallel
  sub-actions: If they are parallel, we enable all of them and don't
  maintain state there; if they're not, we look for an init-action,
  and do maintain state.

<p>
  An action with type 'workflow' will maintain state inside itself.
</p>

<p>
  Can we do away with the extra layer of 'workflow' inside the
  'parallel' track? How do we know that the child workflow has been
  completed -- i guess we do, because we keep the state until its
  parent is gone...

<p>
  Simple: We'd have to keep the row in case_enabled_actions around
  with completed_p = yes until the parent action is also
  complete. When an action is completed, it deletes the rows for all
  its children. If the action does not have a parent action, we delete
  the row (thus we don't keep completed_p rows around for top-level
  actions).

  When a dynamic action is enabled, we create new enabled_action rows
  for each of the child actions/workflows needed
<p>

<h3>Views</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Enabled? Action is enabled if:
    <ol>
      <li>
        It has workflow_actions.always_enabled_p = true
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a row in workflow_fsm_action_en_in_st for the current state and the given action.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Assigned? It's assigned if: trigger_type = 'user', state-action map has 
    assigned_p = true, it has an assigned_role.
  </li>
  <li>
    What's the assigned role? (For dynamic actions, there may not be
    an assigend role, if the assignees are in the
    workflow_case_action_assignees table.) Pick the parties from the 
    workflow_case_role_map.
  </li>
  <li>
    Who are the assignees?
    <ol>
      <li>
        Find the users:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Find the parties:
            <ol>
              <li>
                If there are rows in workflow_case_action_assignees for the
                action, that's the parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise, the parties are in the workflow_case_role_map for
                role workflow_actions.assigned_role.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use party_approved_member_map to find the users.
          </li>

<h3>Engine Algorithms</h3>

<pre>
state_changed_handler
--------------------
- find all actually enabled actions
  - chase the action-state-map for all current_states
  - add children of enabled actions, where the child has always_enabled_p = true, 
    or the parent has trigger_type = parallel or dynamic.
- enable all new actions

enable
------
- if trigger_type = workflow, find and execute child action with trigger_type = init.
- if trigger_type = parallel, find subactions and ::enable them
- if trigger_type = dynamic, we'll need code to determine which children to ::enable, and how to create them

execute_state_change
--------------------
- if action.new_state not null
  - if there's a state with the same parent_action_id as the action being executed, update that state with new_state
  - otherwise insert row with new_state

complete
--------
- if action.parent_action_id not null
  - set workflow_case_enabled_actions.completed_p = true
  - call child_state_changed_handler -action_id $parent_action_id
- otherwise, delete row in workflow_case_enabled_actions
  - delete all child rows

child_state_changed_handler
---------------------------
- trigger_type = workflow/parallel/dynamic:
  - if there are no actions with parent_action_id = :action_id, completed_p = false, 
    then call ::action::execute on the parent action


calculating the actual state-action map (which we can do later, if we want to)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- apply the state-action mapping table
- add always-enabled actions with parent_id to the states in which their parent is enabled (or all, if no parent)
- add actions with parent.trigger_type dynamic/parallel to states in which their parent is enabled
</pre>


<pre>
always_enabled_p
----------------
- if parent_action_id is null, it means it's always enabled

- if parent action is trigger_type workflow, it means it's enabled when its parent workflow is enabled.
  -> ::enable it after starting the workflow, i.e. executing the initial action
  -> will it stay enabled?
  -> it will get disabled automatically by cascading delete when its parent is deleted

- if parent action is trigger_type parallel, it has no meaning, all the parent's children will get enabled, anyway

- if parent action is trigger_type dynamic, same shit, no semantics


How about the state_changed_handler only deals with state change at a particular parent_enabled_action_id level?


</pre>

<h2><a name="trigger-conditions">Trigger Conditions</a></h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  If any change to any child workflow of a case attempts to trigger
  the parent action, the trigger condition would tell us whether to
  allow the trigger to go through.
</p>

<p>
  The trigger condition could check to see if all child cases are
  completed, or it could check if there's enough to determine the
  outcome, e.g. a 2/3 approval.
</p>


XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX <h4>Child Case State Changed Logic</h4>>
  We execute the OnChildCaseStateChange callback, if any. This gets to
  determine whether the parent action is now complete and should fire.
</p>

<p>
  We provide a default implementation, which simply checks if the
  child cases are in the 'complete' state, and if so, fires.
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: What do we do if any of the child cases are canceled? Consider
  the complete and move on with the parent workflow? Cancel the parent
  workflow?
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: Should we provide this as internal workflow logic or as a
  default callback implementation? If we leave this as a service
  contract with a default implementation, then applications can
  customize. But would that ever be relevant? Maybe this callback is
  never needed.
</p>






<h2><a name="case-state">Case State</a></h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    We want to be able to suspend a case, to reopen it later, without
    having to create an explicit state in the workflow for
    this. Suspending the case means it doesn't show up on people's
    task lists or in reminder emails until it's un-suspended.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the UI, we want to be able to distinguish between cases that
    are considered active and complete, even if the closed ones could
    be reopened to haunt us later. A good example is bug-tracker,
    where bugs in "open" or "resolved" states are considered active
    and should be counted as bugs needing attention, whereas those in
    "closed" state are complete and do not.
  </li>
  <li>
    A case can be canceled, which is the same as suspended, except it
    doesn't resurface unless someone actively goes reopen it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Child cases must be locked down so they cannot be reactivated when
    the parent workflow has moved on to some other state.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Design</h3>

<pre>
create table workflow_cases(
  ...
  state                     char(40)
                            constraint workflow_cases_state_ck
                            check (state in ('active', 'completed',
                            'canceled', 'suspended'))
                            default 'active',
  locked_p                  boolean default 'f',
  suspended_until           timestamptz,
  ...
);
</pre>


<p>
  Cases can be active, complete, suspended, or canceled.
</p>

<p>
  They start out as active. For FSMs, when they hit a state with
  <code>complete_p = t</code>, the case is moved to 'complete'.
</p>

<p>
  Users can choose to cancel or suspend a case. When suspending, they
  can type in a date, on which the case will spring back to 'active'
  life.
</p>

<p>
  When a parent worfklow completes an action with a sub-workflow, the
  child cases that are 'completed' are marked 'closed', and the child
  cases that are 'active' are marked 'canceled'.
</p>

<p>
  The difference between 'completed' and 'closed' is that completed
  does not prevent the workflow from continuing (e.g. bug-tracker
  'closed' state doesn't mean that it cannot be reopened), whereas a
  closed case cannot be reactivarted (terminology confusion alert!).

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  An action does not become avilable until a given list of other
  actions have completed. The advanced version is that you can also
  specify for each of these other tasks how many times they must've
  been executed.
</p>

<p>
  Also, an action can at most be executed a certain number of times.
</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

</pre>

<p>
  When an action is about to be enabled, and before calling the
  CanEnableP callback, we check the workflow_case_enabled_actions table
  to see that the required actions have the required number of rows in
  the workflow_case_enabled_actions table with enabled_state
  'completed'.
</p>

<p>
  The second part, about maximum number of times an action can be
  executed, this could be solved with a row in the above table with
  the action being dependent upon it self with the given max_n value.
</p>




<h2><a name="enable-callback">Enable Condition Callback</a></h2>

<p>
  <b>Action.CanEnableP -> (CanEnabledP)</b>: Gets called when an
  action is about to be enabled, and can be used to prevent the

</p>

<p>
  Is called after all database-driven enable preconditions have been
  met, i.e. FSM enabled-in-state, and "gated on"-conditions.
</p>

<p>
  This will only get called once per case state change, so if the
  callback refuses to let the action become enabled, it will not be
  asked again until the next time an action is executed.
</p>

<p>
  If the callback returns false, the <code>enabled_state</code> of the
  row in <code>workflow_case_enabled_actions</code> will be set to
  'refused' (NOTE: Or the row will be deleted?).

<h2><a name="resolution-codes">Resolution Codes</a></h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  The bug-tracker has resolution codes under the "Resolve" action. It
  would be useful if these could be customized.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, I saw one other dynamic-workflow product (TrackStudio)
  on the web,  and they have the concept of resolution codes
  included. That made me realize that this is generally useful. 
</p>

<p>
  In general, a resolution code is a way of distinguishing different
  states, even though those states are identical in terms of the
  workflow process.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, the code to make these happen is fairly clumsy, what with
  the "FormatLogTitle" callback which we invented.
</p>

<h2><a name="assignment-notif">Assignment Notifications</a></h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  When someone is assigned to an action, we want the notification
  email to say "You are now assigned to these tasks".
</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>
  We'd need to postpone the notifications until we have fully updated
  the workflow state to reflect the changed state, to determine who
  should get the normal notifications, and who should get personalized
  ones.
</p>

<p>
  Notifications doesn't support personalized notifications, but we
  could use acs-mail/acs-mail-lite to send them out instead, and
  exclude them from the normal notifications if they have instant
  notifications set up.
</p>


<h2><a name="assignment-reminder">Assignment Reminders</a></h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  We want to periodically send out email reminders with a list of
  actions the user is assigned to, asking them to come do something
  about it. There should be a link to a web page showing all these
  actions.
</p>

<p>
  For each action we will list the action pretty-name, the name of the
  case object, the date it was enabled, the deadline, and a link to
  the action page, where they can do something about it.
</p>





<h2><a name="trying-to-sum-up">Trying to Sum Up</a></h2>

<h4>Logic to Determine if Action is Enabled</h4>

<p>
  Executed when any action in the workflow has been executed, to
  determine which actions are now enabled.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If there are any rows in workflow_case_enabled_actions for this
    case with enabled_state 'running', no actions can be enabled, the
    action is not enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    Is the model-specific precondition met, e.g. are we in one of the
    action's enabled-in states? If not, the action is not enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    Are other preconditions met, e.g. if the action is gated on other
    actions having executed a minimum number of times, or itself
    having executed a maximum number fo times? If not, the action is
    not enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    Execute the CanEnableP callback. If it returns false, the action
    is not enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    The action is enabled.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> If the action is enabled: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If there are any rows in workflow_case_enabled_actions for this
    action with enabled_state of 'enabled', the action was already
    enabled before. Quit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Otherwise start the "Enabled Action Logic" below.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> If the action is not enabled. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If there are any rows in workflow_case_enabled_actions for this
    action with enabled_state of 'enabled', the action was enabled
    before. Update the row to set 'enabled_state' to 'canceled'.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Enabled Action Logic</h4>

<p>
  Executed when an action which was previously not enabled becomes enabled.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Insert a row into workflow_case_enabled_actions with enabled_state
    = 'enabled', with the proper fire_timestamp: timeout = null ->
    fire_timestamp = nul; timeout = 0 -> fire_timestamp =
    current_timestamp; timeout > 0 -> fire_timestamp =
    current_timestamp + timeout.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the action has a timeout of 0, then call
    workflow::case::action::execute and quit.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Un-Enabled Action Logic</h4>

<p>
  Executed when an action which was previously enabled is no longer
  enabled, because the workflow's state was changed by some other
  action.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    If the action has any child cases, these will be marked canceled.
  </li>
</ol>


<h4>Action Execute Logic</h4>

<p>
  Executed when an enabled action is triggered.
</p>

<ul>
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

  <li>
    If the action has non-null child_workflow, create child cases. For
    each role which has a mapping_type of 'per_member' or 'per_user',
    create one case per member/user of that role. If more roles have
    per_member/per_user setting, then the cartesian product of child
    cases are created (DESIGN QUESTION: Would this ever be relevant?)
  </li>
  <li>
    If there is any ActionEnabled callback, execute that (only the
    first, if multiple exists), and use the workflow_fsm_output_map to
    determine which new state to bump the workflow to, if any.
  </li>
</ol>



<h4>Child Case State Changed Logic</h4>

<p>
  We execute the OnChildCaseStateChange callback, if any. This gets to
  determine whether the parent action is now complete and should fire.
</p>

<p>
  We provide a default implementation, which simply checks if the
  child cases are in the 'complete' state, and if so, fires.
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: What do we do if any of the child cases are canceled? Consider
  the complete and move on with the parent workflow? Cancel the parent
  workflow?
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: Should we provide this as internal workflow logic or as a
  default callback implementation? If we leave this as a service
  contract with a default implementation, then applications can
  customize. But would that ever be relevant? Maybe this callback is
  never needed.
</p>

<h4>On Fire Logic</h4>

<p>
  When the action finally fires.
</p>

<p>
  If there's any OnFire callback defined, we execute this.
</p>

<p>
  If the callback has output values defined, we use the mappings in
  <code>workflow_action_fsm_output_map</code> to determine which state to 
  move to.
</p>

<p>
  After firing, we execute the SideEffect callbacks and send off
  notifications.
</p>

<p>
  DESIGN QUESTION: How do we handle notifications for child cases? We
  should consider the child case part of the parent in terms of
  notifications, so when a child action executes, we notify those who
  have requested notifications on the parent. And when the last child
  case completes, which will also complete the parent action, we
  should avoid sending out duplicate notifications. How?
</p>




<h4>Callback Types</h4>

<ul>
  <li style="color: gray;">
    (Not needed) <b>Action.OnEnable -> (output)</b>: Gets called when an
    action is enabled. Output can be used to determine the new state of
    the case (see below), in particular for an in-progress state. 
  </li>
  <li style="color: gray;">
    (Not needed) <b>Action.OnUnEnable</b>: Gets called when an action that used to be enabled
    is no longer enabled. Is not called when the action fires.
  </li>
  <li style="color: gray;">
    (Not needed) <b>Action.OnChildCaseStateChange -> (output, CompleteP)</b>: Called
    when a child changes its case state
    (active/completed/canceled/suspended). Returns whether the parent
    action has now completed. Output can be used to determine
    the new state of the case (see below).
  </li>
</ul>






<h2><a name="timers">Timers (Implemented)</a></h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  Use cases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A student has one week to send a document to another role. If
    he/she fails to do so, a default action executes.
  </li>
  <li>
    An OpenACS OCT member has one week to vote on a TIP. If he/she does not
    vote within that week, a default "Abstain" action is executed.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The timer will always be of the form "This action will automatically
  execute x amount of time after it becomes enabled". If it is later
  un-enabled (disabled) because another action (e.g. a vote action in
  the second use casae above) was executed, then the timer will be
  reset. If the action later becomes enabled, the timer will start
  anew.
</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>
  We currently do not have any information on which actions are
  enabled, and when they're enabled. We will probably need a table,
  perhaps one just for timed actions, in which a row is created when a
  timed action is enabled, and the row is deleted again when the state
  changes.
</p>

<h4>Extending workflow_actions</h4>

<pre>
create table workflow_actions(
    ...
    -- The number of seconds after having become enabled the action
    -- will automatically execute
    timeout                 interval
    ...
);
</pre>

<p>
  DESIGN NOTE: The 'interval' datatype is not supported in
  Oracle.
</p>

<h4>The Enabled Actions Table</h4>

<pre>
create table workflow_case_enabled_actions(
    case_id                 integer
                            constraint wf_case_enbl_act_case_id_nn
                            not null
                            constraint wf_case_enbl_act_case_id_fk
                            references workflow_cases(case_id)
                            on delete cascade,
    action_id               integer
                            constraint wf_case_enbl_act_action_id_nn
                            not null
                            constraint wf_case_enbl_act_action_id_fk
                            references workflow_actions(action_id)
                            on delete cascade,
    -- the timestamp when this action will fires
    execution_time          timestamptz
                            constraint wf_case_enbl_act_timeout_nn
                            not null,
    constraint workflow_case_enabled_actions_pk
    primary key (case_id, action_id)
);
</pre>

<h4>The Logic</h4>

<p>
  After executing an action, <code>workflow::case::action::execute</code> will:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Delete all actions from <code>worklfow_case_enabled_actions</code> which are no longer enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the timeout is zero, execute immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Insert a row for all enabled actions with timeouts which are not
    already in <code>workflow_case_enabled_actions</code>, with
    <code>fire_timestamp = current_timestamp + workflow_actions.timeout_seconds</code> .
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  NOTE: We need to keep running, so if another automatic action
  becomes enabled after this action fires, they'll fire as well.
</p>

<h4>The Sweeper</h4>

<p>
  The sweeper will find rows in
  <code>workflow_case_enabled_actions</code> with <code>fire_timetsamp
  < current_timestamp</code>, ordered by fire_timstamp, and execute
  them.
</p>

<p>
  It should do a query to find the action to fire first, then release
  the db-handle and execute it. Then do a fresh query to find the
  next, etc. That way we will handle the situation correctly where the
  first action firing causes the second action to no longer be
  enabled.
</p>

<h4>The Optimization</h4>

<p>
  Every time the sweeper runs, at least one DB query will be made,
  even if there are no timed actions to be executed.
</p>

<p>
  Possible optimizations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We keep an NSV with the timestamp (in [clock seconds] format)
    and (case_id, action_id) of the first action to fire. That way,
    the sweeper need not hit the DB at all most of the time.  When a
    new timed action is inserted, we compare with the NSV, and update
    if the new action fires before the old action. When the timed
    action referred to in the NSV is either deleted because it gets
    un-enabled, or executed, we'll clear the NSV, causing the next hit
    to the sweeper to execute the query to find the (case_id,
    action_id, fire_timestamp) of the first action to fire. Finally,
    we would need an NSV value to represent the fact that there are no
    rows in this table, so we don't keep executing the query in that
    case.
  </li>
</ul>
