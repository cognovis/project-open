<h3><a id="id.s1.1.1" name="id.s1.1.1">1.1.1 </a>What does attachments
do?</h3>
<p><tt>attachments</tt> is a service package that allows you to attach one or
more file-storage files to any <tt>acs_object</tt>. <tt>attachments</tt> is
mounted below a package that uses it, and the application provides links into
the attachments package's UI.</p><h3><a id="id.s1.1.2" name="id.s1.1.2">1.1.2
</a>At a high level, how does attachments work?</h3>
<p>Before you can use the attachments package, each instance of your package
must be mapped to a <tt>file-storage root folder</tt>.</p><p>The root folder
is a &quot;super folder&quot; for all the files in that specific instance of
file-storage, and it is created automatically when the file-storage package is
instanciated.</p><p>When a user wants to make an attachment to an object in
your package, she is shown the contents of the file-storage root folder mapped
to your package instance. The user is also given the option to upload a new
file into file-storage to attach.</p><h2><a id="id.s1.2" name="id.s1.2">1.2
</a>Using attachments</h2>
<h3><a id="id.s1.2.1" name="id.s1.2.1">1.2.1 </a>Mount attachments under your
package</h3>
<p>The first step is to mount the attachments package <b>under</b> your
package. In the <tt>site-map</tt>, you should create a new site-node
(sub-folder) under your package called &quot;attach&quot;.
</p><p>&quot;attach&quot; is the standard URL, however URL this can be changed
on a site-wide basis by changing the &quot;RelativeUrl&quot; parameter of
<b>any</b> of the attachments packages (this works since there's only one
instance of attachments in the entire system. The same instance is just
re-mounted)</p><h3><a id="id.s1.2.2" name="id.s1.2.2">1.2.2 </a>Map an
file-storage root folder to your package instance</h3>
<p>First, you must select a file-storage instance that will provide the files
you can attach. If you do not already have an instance of file-storage that
you want to use for your package instance, you must create one using the
site-map.</p><p>Once you have a file-storage instance you wish to use, you
must map the root folder of that file-storage instance with the package_id of
the instance of your package. </p><p>Two utility procs to help you do
this:</p><p><tt>fs::get_root_folder</tt> and
<tt>attachments::map_root_folder</tt></p><h3><a id="id.s1.2.3" name="id.s1.2.3">1.2.3
</a>Attaching files to your objects</h3>
<h4><a id="id.s1.2.3.1" name="id.s1.2.3.1">1.2.3.1 </a>Have your package check
if attachments is mounted properly</h4>
<p>Most likely, you want your package to work even if the attachments package
is not installed on the system or if attachments is not properly mounted. To
do this, add the following proc to your package's API and wrap all calls to
the attachments package with
it:</p><div class="box" style="border: 2px solid; width: 100%"><pre>    ad_proc -private attachments_enabled_p {} {
        set package_id [site_node_apm_integration::child_package_exists_p \
            -package_key attachments
        ]
    }</pre></div><h4><a id="id.s1.2.3.2" name="id.s1.2.3.2">1.2.3.2 </a>Get
the attachment Url</h4>
<p>When you want to set up the link that the user can click on to attach
something to an object, use the attachments::add_attachment_url proc, which
will return the correct Url into the attachments package mounted under your
package.</p><div class="box" style="border: 2px solid; width: 100%"><pre>    if {$attachments_enabled_p} {
        if {$attach_p} {
            set redirect_url [attachments::add_attachment_url \
                                  -object_id $message_id \
                                  -return_url $redirect_url \
                                  -pretty_name &quot;$subject&quot;]
        }
    }</pre></div><p>forums redirects the user to the redirect_url, if the user
chose to add an attachment to their
posting.</p><h3><a id="id.s1.2.4" name="id.s1.2.4">1.2.4 </a>Viewing attached
files</h3>
<p>You can use the &quot;attachments::get_attachments&quot; proc to see the
list of attachments to a given object.</p></body>
