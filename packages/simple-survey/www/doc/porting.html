<h2>Porting to ACS 4.0 - A Case Study</h2>

by <a href="mailto:nstrug@arsdigita.com">Nick Strugnell</a>

<hr>

<p>
This document describes  the steps required  to port a single  ACS 3.x
module, <em>simple survey</em> to ACS  4.0. The total  time to do  the
port, or at   least bring the  module into  a useable  and  reasonably
bug-free state, was 54.5 programmer hours. Note that the programmer in
question had no prior knowledge of  ACS 4.0, nor  of the Oracle object
model used  extensively in ACS 4.0, but   <em>did</em> have some prior
knowledge of  the internal workings  of the simple survey module. Your
mileage may vary.
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>
Why would you want to port a module to  ACS 4.0? The new system offers
significant     advantages     over      3.x,       notably         <a
href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/developer-guide/packages.html">packaging</a>,
a                              unified                              <a
href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/acs-kernel/permissions/design.html">permissions</a>
model                  and                       an                 <a
href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/acs-kernel/object-model/design.html">object
model</a> that simplifies some aspects of implementation.
</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<p>
In the case of the simple survey module I performed the tasks required 
      for the port in the following order:
<ol>
<li>Reorganised files in accordance with the <a
	    href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/developer-guide/packages.html">packaging conventions</a></li>
<li>Registered the new package on a running ACS 4.0 server</li>
<li>Redesigned the data model to use the <a
	    href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/acs-kernel/object-model/design.html">object model</a></li>
<li>Edited pages to use the new
<a href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/acs-kernel/permissions/design.html">permissions</a> 
and
<a href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/acs-kernel/groups/design.html">party</a> 
models</li>
</ol>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>
The  ACS 4.0 packaging  systems replaces  the sometimes haphazard file
layout used in earlier versions. Complete instructions can be found at
<a
href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/developer-guide/packages.html">http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/developer-guide/packages.html</a>
but in essence your file layout should be as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>All files related to a particular package go into
	packages/package-key (where package-key is survey-simple in
	this case)</li>
<li>TCL stored procedures go into packages/survey-simple/tcl</li>
<li>SQL files go into packages/survey-simple/sql</li>
<li>User pages go into packages/survey-simple/www</li>
<li>Admin pages go into packages/survey-simple/admin</li>
<li>Docs go into packages/survey-simple/doc</li>
</ul>

<p>
The packages directory itself is in the server root directory, usually 
      /web/<em>server-name</em>.
</p>

<h3>Registering the Package</h3>

<p>
ACS 4.0 provides easy to use package management facilites to associate
files, watch TCL libraries for changes and mount packages at arbitrary
URLs on the client  site. This is  managed through the admin interface
provided at  acs-admin/apm   under a standard   ACS   4.0 install. The
process is self-explanatory: simply  click on  'Create a new  package'
and fill in the resulting form. You will then be presented with a list
of  files  to  become  part  of the    package,  if extraneous   files
(e.g.  editor backup files)    have  been selected, simply    deselect
them.  Providing naming conventions have been  adhered to, TCL library
files should be so identified and you will  have the option of setting
up  a watch on   them so  that they  are  automatically reloaded  when
changed. This is useful  during the development  process as it negates
the need to restart AOLserver every time  a change is  made in the TCL
library.
</p>

<h3>Mounting the Package</h3>

<p>
Once a package has been installed it needs to be  mounted before it is
visible to  users.   This is done   using the  site administration  at
acs-admin. First, select  the subsite on  which you  want to mount  an
instance of the package and then select Site Map. In a default ACS 4.0
installation there is only one subsite, Main Site  and its site map is
available at admin/site-map.
</p>

<p>
We then need to  create  a new  URL under an  existing  URL - for  the
infoshare site I created  a  URL, investor_profiling_tool, under   the
root. Do this by clicking on the 'new sub folder' option alongisde and
existing URL and entering the  name for the  URL - note that this does
<em>not</em> have to be the same as the package key.
</p>

<p>
Next, we  must  mount the package.  If   the package has  been mounted
before, you may simply select the 'mount' option alongside the new URL
and select the  package.  However, if this is  the first time you have
mounted the package, select 'new application'.   You can then name the
application  (give it a  pretty name rather than  the package key) and
select the package from a  select box. This  way, you can have several
instances  of   a package,  perhaps  some  unmounted and some mounted,
simultaneously at different URLs on the same site.
</p>

<h3>Data Model</h3>

<p>
Rewriting the data  model is possibly  the hardest part of  performing
the  port, as the  object  system employed may seem counter-intuitive to
programmers who have cut their OOP teeth on C++ or Java.
The principal decision to be  made is which objects in your
module should  be  converted to  the  object  model,  and which should
remain as simple tables. There is no clear answer  to this, but a rule
of  thumb is  that any table  that contains  a reference to  the users
table in  ACS   3.x, <i>i.e.</i> any   table  that  you  will  perform
permissions tests on, should be converted  to the object model. Additionally, any table which is to be included in the site-wide search should be made on object. In the
case of simple survey,  I  converted the <tt>survsimp_surveys</tt>  (individual
surveys), <tt>survsimp_questions</tt> (questions  which  make up a survey)  and
<tt>survsimp_responses</tt> (collections  of   answers forming a  single  users
response to a survey) tables to the object model.
</p>

<p>
All object types are derived from the <tt>acs_object</tt> type, so we declare a 
      <tt>survsimp_survey</tt> type using the following PL/SQL block:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
begin
    acs_object_type.create_type (
	    	supertype => 'acs_object',
		object_type => 'survsimp_survey',
		pretty_name => 'Simple Survey',
		pretty_plural => 'Simple Surveys',
		table_name => 'SURVSIMP_SURVEYS',
		id_column => 'SURVEY_ID'
    );
end;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The new object type, <tt>survsimp_survey</tt>, is associated with a table,
      <tt>survsimp_surveys</tt> (note the pluralisation), each row of which
      will be an instance of the <tt>survsimp_survey</tt> type:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
create table survsimp_surveys (
	survey_id		constraint survsimp_surveys_survey_id_fk
				references acs_objects (object_id)
                                constraint survsimp_surveys_pk
				primary key,
	name			varchar(100)
				constraint survsimp_surveys_name_nn
				not null,
	-- short, non-editable name we can identify this survey by
	short_name		varchar(20)
				constraint survsimp_surveys_short_name_u
				unique
				constraint survsimp_surveys_short_name_nn
				not null,
	description		varchar(4000)
				constraint survsimp_surveys_desc_nn
				not null,
        description_html_p      char(1)
                                constraint survsimp_surv_desc_html_p_ck
				check(description_html_p in ('t','f')),
	enabled_p               char(1)
				constraint survsimp_surveys_enabled_p_ck
				check(enabled_p in ('t','f')),
	-- limit to one response per user
	single_response_p	char(1)
				constraint survsimp_sur_single_resp_p_ck
				check(single_response_p in ('t','f')),
	single_editable_p	char(1)
				constraint survsimp_surv_single_edit_p_ck
				check(single_editable_p in ('t','f')),
	type                    varchar(20)
);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Compare this with the <tt>survsimp_surveys</tt> table in 3.x (items missing in
      the 4.0 version highlighted):
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<font color=red>create sequence survsimp_survey_id_sequence start with 1;</font>

create table survsimp_surveys (
        survey_id               integer primary key,
        name                    varchar(100) not null,
        -- short, non-editable name we can identify this survey by
        short_name              varchar(20) unique not null,
        description             varchar(4000) not null,
        description_html_p      char(1) default 'f'
                                constraint survsimp_sur_desc_html_p_ck
                                check(description_html_p in ('t','f')),
        <font color=red>creation_user           not null references users(user_id),</font>
        <font color=red>creation_date           date default sysdate,</font>
        enabled_p               char(1) default 'f' check(enabled_p in ('t','f')),
        -- limit to one response per user       
        single_response_p       char(1) default 'f' check(single_response_p in ('t','f')),
        single_editable_p       char(1) default 't' check(single_editable_p in ('t','f')),
        type                    varchar2(20) default 'general'
); 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that  the ACS 4.0 version  has  fewer columns.  This is because
<tt>creation_user</tt>   and  <tt>creation_date</tt>   are   inherited
(kinda) from the acs_object  type, and do not   need to be included  in the
survsimp_surveys table.  Additionally, the <tt>survey_id</tt> is now a
reference to the <tt>object_id</tt> column of the <tt>acs_objects</tt>
table and  no longer  has  a sequence associated  with  it. In fact an
instantiation of the <tt>survsimp_survey</tt> type should always use a
<tt>survey_id</tt>    generated   by  the   <tt>acs_object_id_seq</tt>
sequence,  as should any type    derived from the  <tt>acs_object</tt>
type.
</p>

<p>
Finally a constructor and  destructor for the <tt>survsimp_survey</tt>
type are required. These are PL/SQL procedures stored inside a package:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>

end survsimp_survey;

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The  constructor,   <tt>survsimp_survey.new</tt>,     and  destructor,
<tt>survsimp_survey.delete</tt>,   are  declared   in   the <tt>create
package</tt>  statement and  defined in   the the  <tt>create  package
body</tt> statement.  The function of the constructor  is to create an
instance of <tt>acs_object</tt>   and  insert a row   referencing that
instance   to the  <tt>survsimp_surveys</tt>  table.   The  destructor
deletes    both       the       <tt>acs_object</tt>     and        the
<tt>survsimp_surveys</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>
Permissions checking under ACS 4.0 has been much simplified and is one
of the most compelling reasons to migrate from 3.x.  Under ACS 4.0 all
permissions checks boil down to the question <i>Can x perform action y
on object z?</i>. The actions are defined by the module writer.
</p>

<p>
The following PL/SQL statements define self explanatory actions on the 
      simple survey package:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
begin

	acs_privilege.create_privilege('survsimp_create_survey');
	acs_privilege.create_privilege('survsimp_delete_survey');
        acs_privilege.create_privilege('survsimp_modify_survey');
	acs_privilege.create_privilege('survsimp_create_question');
	acs_privilege.create_privilege('survsimp_delete_question');
        acs_privilege.create_privilege('survsimp_modify_question');
	acs_privilege.create_privilege('survsimp_take_survey');
end;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
When the package is registered with the ACS 4.0 package manager, these
permissions   become   available   to  the   permissions   manager  at
/permissions,  which can be used  assign  these permissions to various
users.         I      also     created        a       super-privilege,
<tt>survsimp_admin_survey</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
begin
	acs_privilege.create_privilege('survsimp_admin_survey');

	acs_privilege.add_child('survsimp_admin_survey','survsimp_create_survey');
	acs_privilege.add_child('survsimp_admin_survey','survsimp_delete_survey');
	acs_privilege.add_child('survsimp_admin_survey','survsimp_modify_survey');
	acs_privilege.add_child('survsimp_admin_survey','survsimp_create_question');
	acs_privilege.add_child('survsimp_admin_survey','survsimp_delete_question');
	acs_privilege.add_child('survsimp_admin_survey','survsimp_modify_question');
end;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <tt>acs_privilege.add_child</tt> function  adds the  privilege  in
the second argument to that in the first, so  in this case anyone with
the  <tt>survsimp_admin_survey</tt> privilege  has  full privileges to
create, modify and delete surveys and questions.
</p>

<p>
How  are  the new permissions  used?  The simplest  way  is to use the
<tt>ad_require_permission</tt>     TCL  procedure.    This  takes  two
arguments,  an <tt>object_id</tt> and the   privilege required. If the
current   user does not have  the  required privilege,  he   or she is
presented   with  an   error    message.   For    example, the    page
survey-simple/www/one.tcl,  which  presents  a survey   to  a user who
wishes to take it, contains the single line:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
ad_require_permission $survey_id survsimp_take_survey
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the user has not been assigned the <tt>survsimp_take_survey</tt>
	  privilege, he or she will not be able to proceed. A slightly 
	  more complicated case is seen in
	  survey-simple/www/admin/question-modify-text.tcl:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
ad_require_permission $question_id survsimp_modify_question
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, the user  will not be able to  proceed unless he  or she has the
survsimp_modify_question granted on  this  particular question. Rather
than  grant privileges  on  every  single  question in  a survey,  the
<tt>context_id</tt>  parameter  of  the <tt>survsimp_question.new</tt>
parameter is used to allow privileges granted to  a user regarding the
survey, to also apply to the questions. When a  question is created by
a  call to  <tt>survsimp_question.new</tt> the <tt>context_id</tt>  is
set to the <tt>survey_id</tt> of the survey of which the question is a
member. Any user who has privileges over the survey, automatically has
the same privileges over the questions. Thus, if a user is granted the
<tt>survsimp_admin_survey</tt>  privilege over  the survey, he  or she
will  have  <tt>survsimp_admin_survey</tt>  privilege,   and hence the
<tt>survsimp_modify_question</tt>  privilege over all the questions of
which that survey is comprised.
</p>

<p>
Another case is when we simply want to control access to a page rather
than    a  particular  object. For   example,    only  users with  the
<tt>survsimp_admin_survey</tt> privilege should be permitted to access
survey-simple/www/admin/index.tcl. In this case, we use:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
ad_require_permission [ad_conn package_id] survsimp_admin_survey
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This  checks  if the user has  the  correct privilege for the package,
which itself is simply and instance of the <tt>acs_object</tt> type.
</p>

<p>
Finally, privileges can be used in SQL statements to restrict the rows 
	  retrieved. For example, not all users have permission to
	  take all surveys. In survey-simple/www/index.tcl, we present 
	  the user with a list of the surveys he or she is permitted
	  to take using the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
db_multirow surveys survey_select {
    select survey_id, name
    from survsimp_surveys, acs_objects
    where object_id = survey_id
    and context_id = :package_id
    and acs_permission.permission_p(object_id, :user_id, 'survsimp_take_survey') = 't'
    and enabled_p = 't'
    order by upper(name)
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
