    Mail System Design
    ------------------

    1.  The mail store

        The mail store is a complex problem.  On the one hand, we
        could simply store RFC822 messages in raw form.
        Unfortunately, this could lead to serious problems when trying
        to manipulate messages.  (For example, the code to parse out
        part 2.1.5 of a message would have to actuall parse MIME.)  It
        might be better to use a view in which MIME messages are
        pre-separated into parts.  Or perhaps a single message is
        stored and a "part" table describes the ranges covered by
        various MIME parts.

        More research into this needs to be done.  For the short term,
        using a non-MIME mechanism for storing information we wish to
        send out (attachments in bboard, the like) is sufficient.  The
        conversion can be done at mail send time.  Received email can
        be treated as text/plain for the moment, even when it is
        richer.

        Here's a plan for the table design:

        message_body
        ------------
        rfc822_id
        header_from
        header_date
        header_message_id
        header_content_type
        ... others

        message
        -------
        message_id
        rfc822_id
        env_from
        env_to

        With each message_body being associated with a content value
        from the acs_contents table (or CR revisions table.)

        Notice that each message body belongs to one *or more*
        messages.  This is because the same message might be addressed
        to more than one recipient, but still be the same message.
        Because of this it is recommended that editing messages take
        place via "copy on write" rather than "modify in place".  This
        will allow messages to be edited, but for old versions in
        other locations not be be lost.  (Keep the message_id the
        same, but point it at a new rfc822_id for the body.)

        Separating messages from message_bodies also makes it more
        clear how to determine what access control and URL any message
        belongs to.  Each message belongs in only one place, but the
        message_body may be shared.

        The above design for message_body should include whatever
        header fields are determined to be necessary and useful.
        Difficulties arise, since for email addresses it would be nice
        for this version to point at parties, but the "from" header of
        messages may actually contain more than one address, and so
        on.  Some thought needs to be applied here.



    2.  Sending email

        The first iteration should send email using ns_sendmail or the
        Oracle UTL_SMTP stuff.  ns_sendmail is preferred, since it's
        much higher level than UTL_SMTP.

        A simple queue should be sufficient for sending.  Each message
        may be queued to be sent to various people, like so:

        outgoing_message_queue
        ----------------------
        message_id

        Notice that the pointer is to a message, not a message body.
        The expectation is that a new message is created (to contain
        the new envelope information), and that that message is
        recorded in this queue.
 
        Once the message is sent, the message is removed from this
        queue (and possibly added to an audit trail?  Kept in the
        queue marked as done?)

        The requirement to be able to delete messages from the system
        immediately after deletion means that there are some other
        issues here.  See "open issues" below.



    3.  Receiving email

        The simplest design for receiving email into various queues
        assumes that each message actually belongs to one and only one
        queue:

        incoming_message_queue
        ----------------------
        message_id
        queue_name

        A table can describe a set of rules (with like patterns?) to
        use to determine what queue_name should be used for initial
        insertion.  This gives any application the capability to
        periodically find all new messages that it's interested in
        processing.  Removal from the queue is per application
        request.

        An alternative method is for messages to go in all queues with
        matching requirements.  The same as above, only unique on the
        pair instead of just message_id.  This would allow messages to
        be placed into multiple queues for processing by more than one
        application.  I suspect this is unnecessary.

        A final thought is that it would be possible to simply record
        message ids in this table (as in the outgoing queue.)  Then
        individual applications do a select over the incoming message
        queue, looking for interesting messages.  When they are
        finished, they delete the message.  Again, this is based on
        the "no message will belong to more than one application"
        model.



    4.  Manipulating messages

        This is a difficult task in Tcl, since MIME is fairly
        complicated.  There is already a good API for Java.  I suggest
        that for the Tcl API, simple abilities to deal with encoding
        (and later possibly decoding) messages with multipart/mixed
        and multipart/alternative content types.  This will require
        good base64 encoding tools in Tcl.



    5.  Open questions

        The biggest open question is garbage collection.
        Paradoxically, the split into messages and message_bodys may
        help with this.  Since we can imagine that each application
        keeps its own message_body object, the application is allowed
        to delete that message_body in a reasonable way.  At that
        point, it's sufficient to periodically clear the message store
        of any message bodies that have no associated messages!

        Extension of the message class also becomes more possible.
        When a new message comes in to be entered into a bboard forum,
        the bboard application can create a new message object
        pointing at the same message body.  The new message object can
        be a "bboard_message".  Previously, acs_messaging would create
        the message object, and bboard would have to deal with it even
        if it were a "normal" message.

        It is unclear at this point whether this system should
        actually provide mechanisms to automatically build digests.
        On the one hand, it already has scheduled tasks to do such
        things.  On the other hand, putting the generic mechanisms to
        handle collation and the like into the system is messy.  And
        on top of that, there are optimizations that applications can
        do.  (For example, bboard could build a single message_body
        for a daily digest and send it out to all subscribers, instead
        of messaging building a customized message for each
        subscriber, because it can't determine that they would all be
        the same.)



    6.  Data model in short:


                        outgoing_message_queue
                         | (message_id)
                         |
        message_body -- message --<|------------ [ extended by application ]
           (rfc822_id)   | (message_id)
                         |
                        incoming_message_queue
                           (message_id, queue_name)
                
        A scheduled process periodically sends any messages in the
        outgoing message_queue and deletes the message entry.

        When messages arrive, some MTA mechanism inserts them as a
        message_body, with a message containing the envelope info, and
        puts that message into the appropriate
        incoming_message_queues.  

        A scheduled process periodically deletes any message_body for
        which there exists no referencing message.

        Each message belongs to an individual application.  That
        application is responsible for removing it once it is no
        longer needed (and then GC can be accomplished.)
