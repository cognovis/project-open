	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>
	  This document explains the structure and function of the acs-mail
	  package in OpenACS 4.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		acs-mail is a package that provides basic mail services to other
		OpenACS packages.
	  </p>
	</blockquote>

	<h3>A Little History</h3>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>
		Within aD's version of ACS 4.x, there were three packages that
		handled outgoing email messaging - acs-messaging, acs-mail and
		acs-notifications. acs-messaging was built using the content
		repository to allow the bboard package to send out email. acs-mail
		came later with a little more mail functionality, including the
		ability to send out multipart email messages. acs-notification was
		a package that maintained a complex mail queue (the other two
		packages implemented much simpler queues that place most of the
		burden on the MTA). It also implemented a mail package inside
		Oracle that sent the outgoing mail. Both acs-mail and acs-messaging
		use ns_sendmail to send out mail, making them db-independent.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Our first goal was to simplify this by removing the notifications
		package and replacing that functionality (basically one function)
		inside acs-mail. Another goal was to have acs-mail use the content
		repository so that it can take advantage of all the CR functions.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		We haven't merged acs-messaging and acs-mail, although I think that
		we should do this at some point. Currently, they provide very
		similar functionality.
	  </p>
	</blockquote>

	<h3>Package overview</h3>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>
		There are a few basic tables that the user needs to know about. The
		<b>acs_mail_bodies</b> table contains the attributes of the mail
		message. The most important column in this table is the
		content_item_id attribute. This is a space for a cr_item from the
		Content Repository. Note that this column is a foreign key to
		acs_objects, rather than to cr_items as one would expect. This is
		because the API uses this column to decide whether or not the
		message is a simple message or a multipart message. If the column
		contains a value which is present in acs_mail_multiparts, then the
		message is a multipart message. If not, then it is a simple
		message. Thus the column can't be a foreign key to cr_items since
		in the case of multipart messages, it won't contain a cr_item's
		item_id. Also, note that you should not use header_from and
		header_to columns in this table. Instead, you'll create the mail
		body as a generic mail body and then give it a from: and to: value
		when you queue it. So why are they there? Good question. It may be
		that they are there for incoming messages. But since that is not
		implemented, I'm not sure.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The table <b>acs_mail_body_headers</b> allows you to add arbitrary
		headers to your message. The column body_id in this table is a
		foreign key to acs_mail_bodies
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The table <b>acs_mail_links</b> contains 2 columns - a mail_link_id
		and a body_id. After you create a acs_mail_body, you'll create a
		mail_link and then insert the mail_link into the queue. Why the
		abstraction? This was initially meant to be a point where garbage
		collection could occur. So, other applications are supposed to
		subclass acs_mail_links to their own use. They create a message
		body and a mail_link. Once they're done, they delete the
		mail_link. A scheduled process then looks for any message_bodies
		that are not linked to mail_links any more. It deletes these
		messages. This is not implemented yet (but would be rather easy to
		do).
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Think of acs_mail_bodies as 'message bodies' and acs_mail_links as
		'messages'. An application can send the same email to multiple
		people by creating one message body but associating that message
		body with multiple messages.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The table <b>acs_mail_queue_messages</b> is a table that contains
		mail_links. The table <b>acs_mail_queue_outgoing</b> is the
		outgoing queue and is a foreign key to acs_mail_queue_messages. It
		also contains 2 other columns, envelope_from and envelope_to. This
		is where you address the email. The table
		<b>acs_mail_queue_incoming</b> looks just like the outgoing
		queue. The plan is for the MTA to create mail bodies when incoming
		messages arrive. It should then insert that mail_body into the
		incoming queue. Other applications should then periodically scan
		the incoming queue and grab messages that it wants (presumably
		matching a pattern of some sort) and then deletes the message from
		the incoming queue.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The table <b>acs_mail_multiparts</b> contains the information about
		multipart messages. The column multipart_kind is either
		'alternative' or 'mixed' (are there others?). The table
		<b>acs_mail_multipart_parts</b> then contains the individual parts.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The tcl procedure <b>acs_mail_process_queue</b> runs every 15
		minutes and sends out any messages in the outgoing queue.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The acs-notifications package is built on top of acs-mail and hides
		the complexity from the user (if you're satisfied with creating
		plain-text messages). It's described next.
	  </p>

	</blockquote>

	<h3>How to send a notification</h3>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>
		The simplest feature of the acs-mail package is the ability to send
		a notification. A notification is a plain text email that is sent
		from one party to another. With ACS 4.x, this was done using the
		acs-notifications package as follows:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
		nt.post_request (
		  party_from   => :party_from,
		  party_to     => :party_to,
		  expand_group => 'f',
		  subject      => 'my subject',
		  message      => 'plain text message',
		  max_retries  => 3
		);
	  </pre>
	  <p>
		party_from and party_to are party_id's from the parties table. If
		expand_group is true and party_to is a group_id, then the procedure
		will send the email to each of the group's members. If expand_group
		is false, then the email will only be sent to the group email
		address.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The openacs version is very similar. The max_retries parameter is
		not used because, as mentioned above, acs-mail's queue is very
		simple and relies on the MTA. So max_retries must be zero. Here's
		the openacs version:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
		select acs_mail_nt__post_request (
		  :party_from,     -- p_party_from
		  :party_to,       -- p_party_to
		  'f',             -- p_expand_group
		  :subject,        -- p_subject
		  :message,        -- p_message
		  0                -- p_max_retries
		);
	  </pre>
	  <p>
		We've also overloaded the function so that you can call the
		function with only the 4 essential parameters: party_from,
		party_to, subject, and message.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
		Note that acs-notifications is now completely gone. So event the
		oracle queries have to be converted from nt.post_request to
		acs_mail_nt.post_request. acs_mail_nt.cancel_requet is also
		supported. All the other nt functions are deprecated and their
		replacements (if any) are described in the file
		packages/acs-mail/sql/oracle/acs-mail-nt-create.sql (or the
		corresponding file in the postgresql directory)
	  </p>

	<h3>Creating a HTML message</h3>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>
		Creating a simple email message consists of the following steps:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
		<li>Create a CR item with your message </li>
		<li>Create a new acs_mail_body with content_item=(item_id of your CR item) </li>

	<h3>Some other notes</h3>
	<blockquote>
	  <ul>
		<li>In order to schedule a message, you must call
		acs_mail_queue_message__new <b>AND</b> then insert the message into
		acs_mail_queue_outgoing table. You would think that the __new
		function would do this, but it doesn't. In a way, it makes
		sense. It allows you to queue one message and then to put that
		message into the outgoing queue multiple times with different 'To:
		addresses'. </li>

		<li>The tcl procedure that sends out the mail
		(<b>acs_mail_process_queue</b>) calls a procedure
		<b>acs_mail_body_to_output_format</b> that sets up the parameters
		to call ns_sendmail. This proc gets the from and to address from
		acs_mail_bodies. <b>acs_mail_process_queue</b> then overwrites the
		from and to address with the values from envelope_from and
		envelope_to in the acs_mail_queue_outgoing table. So, if you supply
		the from and to address in acs_mail_bodies, they get overwritten by
		whatever is in acs_mail_queue_outgoing. (Actually it's a little
		more complicated than that because <b>acs_mail_body_to_output_format</b>
		also adds the addresses as Headers in the 5th param to ns_sendmail,
		so you could get duplicate To: and From: headers. <b>Bottom line</b>:
		Don't fill in the To: and From: fields in acs_mail_bodies. Instead,
		create a unaddressed mail body and then provide the To: and From:
		address in acs_mail_queue_outgoing.</li>

		<li>Garbage collection is mentioned a lot, but not implemented. </li>

		<li>There are some other procs available both in plsql and tcl, so
		take a look at the source files. </li>

	  </ul>
