    Mail System Requirements
    ------------------------

    1.  The system will be able to store messages as rich as MIME
        compliant email messages.  In order to do so:

        a.  The system must be able to store messages with complex
            sub-part structure, with mixed character sets.  This
            includes attachments, digital signatures, and
            multi-variety messages, as well as embedded MIME messages.

        b.  The system must be capable of fully representing RFC822
            and MIME email messages.  Semantics-preserving operations
            (such as limited header reordering) may be allowable, but
            in general, the system should be able to receive a message
            and then later send out that same message bit-for-bit
            identically.

        c.  The system should be able to record extra envelope
            information outside the message itself, for reference when
            processing messages.

    2.  The system will be able to send messages via SMTP, and
        possibly other mechanisms.

        a.  The initial version must be able to send mail via an SMTP
            connection to the local host.  This solution is easy to
            implement and provides the most portable (if not the most
            efficient) mechanism available.

        b.  In order to best support sysadmins, the system should be
            able to call external programs to queue mail instead of
            using an SMTP connection.

        c.  While all messages may be stored in the message store at
            some point, it must be possible to send a message in
            "delete immediately mode" so that it is not stored
            forever.  This is to support sending of passwords via
            email.

    3.  The system will be able to receive messages via various
        mechanisms and queue the messages up for review by other
        systems.

        a.  Each incoming message should be stored in the message
            store.

        b.  When a message arrives, some set of rules should determine
            what queues the message belongs to.  Most likely, pattern
            matching on a small number of headers will suffice.

        c.  A variety of mechanisms for message insertion may be
            supported further in the future, but the initial version
            must support at least a simple delivery program that
            accepts the message on stdin, envelope information as
            arguments, and places the message into the database.

    4.  The system will be able to manipulate complex MIME messages.
        The full set of operations is not yet clear, but it must
        certainly be possible to access individual parts of messages,
        get header information about a given message, and create a
        message based on some set of parts to be included.  In
        addition, mechanisms to do conversion between character sets,
        content types, and encoding should eventually be supported.

        Some of these mechanisms already exist, and their suitability
        for the use of the system should be examined.
