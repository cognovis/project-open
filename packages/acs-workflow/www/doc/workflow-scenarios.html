<h2>Workflow Scenarios</h2>

By <a href="http://www.pinds.com/lars">Lars Pind</a> on June 7, 2000

Three obvious scenarios come to mind:

<ul>

<li>User registration

<li>Ticket tracker

<li>Publishing

</ul>


<h3>User Registration</h3>

<p>

This is the workflow as it is today. The user starts out in the
initial state on the left. Then there's an AND-split, a transition
that triggers automatically, allowing the next two steps to proceed
concurrently (or at least in any order).

<p>

The email verification transition is external (hence the letter,
because the workflow system receives a message that it has occured),
The admin approval is a user action, i.e. something a user must
do. After both of these activities have taken place, the automatic
AND-join transition can occur, and the user moves into authorized
state.

<p>

The rest, we probably wouldn't use workflows for. We'd let the
workflow end in authorized. Banning the user is something that happens
outside the workflow and can happen at any time. But as modeled here,
the administrator can ban the user, thus moving him into the banned
state, from which he can be unbanned.

<p>

We'd probably also add an OR-split/join around the email verification
transition, with a timed transition that occurs when the user hasn't
verified his account after a certain amount of time, ending the
workflow prematurely.

<p>

All workflows have a higher-level workflow associated with them, which
allows us to cancel or suspend the entire case at any time. This would
be used for denying a user access to the system. While there are
extensions with hierarchy to Petri Nets that would be the conceptual
model behind this, we won't do it this way. What we do is use a
finite-state machine with states 'initiated', 'running', 'suspended',
'canceled', 'completed'. That will be sufficient for our purposes,
while not burning any bridges for moving to the right thing later on.

<p>

The advantage of using a generic workflow subsystem for this is that
it allows for easy customization. Siemens, for instance, have pretty
tight security measures for approving users, sometimes requiring the
user to go over his information again before allowing access. The
above workflow could easily be extended with this functionality. Also,
if, say, several independent departments need to be involved in
approving users, the workflow subsystem would be what coordinates that
effort.


<h3>Ticket Tracker</h3>

<p>

This workflow starts with the user specifying his problem, thus
putting the workflow into the open state. Once here, it will pop up on
the responsive user's to-do list (sometimes called an in-basket),
prompting for a fix. This user looks at the case and determines
whether he can fix it or if he needs more info. This determines what
new state, the workflow enters. You know the rest.

<p>

As before, the workflow system by default supports cancel and postpone
actions, determining the overall state of the case. Since the workflow
subsystem is what coordinates the effort, it would also be the
workflow subsystem that takes handles communication between
participants. In other words, the user responsible for performing an
action on a case, can put in a message on the case at any time, with
or without a workflow action being performed. All systems using the
workflow subsystem would benefit from that.


<h3>Publishing/Content Submission</h3>

I'll draw it up a little later, but the important point to note is
that there will be several workflow instances associated with the same
content item, namely one per major revision. One major revision
travels from authoring over editing, to publishing. Once published (or
even before), another workflow can be started on a new major revision
of the content item. Minor revisions is what happens when the author,
editor or publisher modifies an item, on its way to publishing. Major
revision is what happens, when a new workflow process is started from
afresh.

<h3>Employee Pipeline</h3>


<h3>Sales Pipeline</h3>


<h3>Project Lifecycle</h3>
