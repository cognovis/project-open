Workflow Requirements

<hr>

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

This document is the requirements document for the Workflow Package to
be released with ACS 4.0.



<h3>II. Vision Statement</h3>

Many web sites define non-trivial processes for creating and
manipulating classes of objects that represent some higher level
concept, like a task to be performed, or a document or something.

<p>

In the ACS, we have several modules that define such processes,
including:

<ul>

<li>The ticket tracker has issues that transition from
open to closed through various states.

<li>The bboard system allows content to be moderated in various ways.

<li>The user registration system allows site administrators to control
registration in various ways.

<li>The content management system must allow users to add content, and
for editors to approve or update content before, say, the content is
made "live".

</ul>

These processes all have the following form:

<ul>

<li>The process acts upon objects of a certain type. 

<li>The process is the same for every objects of this type. Currently 
this feature is not supported. 

<li>For each instance of the object type, the process can be
characterized as a series of possibly conditional and otherwise
complex transitions that move the object from some initial state to
one or more final states, after which the process is over. In this
way, we can think of processes as types related to the object type,
and we can think of a single *instance* of a process being implicitly
created whenever an object of the related type is created.

</ul>

For example, the ticket tracker defines a process for handling each
ticket. When a new ticket is inserted into the system, in the
abstract, a new instance of this process is created. The ticket starts
in the "open" state, or whatever, and can transition into various
intermediate states before becoming "closed". As long as the ticket
exists, the process instance connected to that ticket also
exists. But, the process instance is a purely abstract object, it has
no concrete representation outside the ticket itself.

<p>

In the current system, the rules for the state transitions are encoded
in the logic of the pages that make up the module that defines both
the object type and the process. 

<p>

The motivation for the workflow module is to define a more abstract
and reusable mechanism for describing these processes.


<h3>Glossary</h3>

Given this, and the above examples, we will use the following
terminology:

<dl>

<dt>Workflow

<dd>a formal definition of a type of process for handling all objects
of a certain type, e.g. the process for dealing with a ticket in the
ticket-tracker.

<dt>Case

<dd>a single instance of a workflow, operating on a single object of a
given type. For example, a ticket is a case.

<dt>Task

<dd>a single atomic step in a workflow, for example the tasks "fix
bug" and "acknowledge fix" in the ticket-tracker workflow.

<dt>Worklist

<dd>a list of tasks that have been assigned to a given user in the
system. For example, the list of "fix"-tasks for the tickets you're
assigned to fix, and the "approve fix"-tasks for the tickets you've
opened and that have been fixed in the meantime.

</dl>

<h3>III. System Overview</h3>

The workflow package consists of three separate parts. 

<ol>

<li>The <b>engine</b> is the subsystem that stores the workflow
definitions and manages the workflow of individual cases. It should be
defined in a way that is independent of the user interface parts of
the system, so other modules don't have to buy into the workflow
package UI in order to employ the engine.

<p>

<li>The <b>end-user interface</b> which will let the users see their
work list and provide mechanisms for the user to give feedback on
their actions to the system.

<p>

<li>The <b>administrative user interface</b>, which will let an
administrator design and maintain workflow definitions and their
application to different types of cases.

</ol>

</ul>


<h3>V. User-Scenarios</h3>

There are two classes of users for the Workflow package:

<ol>

<li><b>Normal users</b> use the workflow package to see what tasks
they should perform and give feedback on their progress.

<li><b>Administrators</b> define and maintain the workflow definitions
that governs the tasks executed by normal users.

</ol>

<b>Annie Administrator</b> is the administrator of a technical support
knowledge library. For each item in the library, a moderator needs to
figure out the subject and designate two qualified reviewers to review
the item. Those reviewers will independently review the item, which
may then have to go back to the original author for revision. After
both reviewers are satisfied, it goes to the
uber-categorization-meister, which will determine what categories and
keywords to attach to it.

<p>

Annie Administrator uses the administrative user interface to formally
define her workflow, and she defines that objects in the technical
support knowledge library will be processed according to this
workflow.

<p>

<b>Tracy Techsupporter</b> submits a new item to be included in the
library. The workflow package (triggered by a hook in ACS Core) will
start a new workflow case around the item.  This in turn will trigger
an email notification to <b>Mike Moderator</b> (and other moderators,
if there is more than one person capable of performing the moderator
task), informing him that he now has a new item on his work list. The
email will contain the URLs for both his work list and the new item.

<p>

When Mike Moderator visits his work list, he'll see the list of tasks
that he has reported to be currently working on, and a list of tasks
he is capable of performing, ordered by priority. When he clicks on
one of these tasks, he'll get to a page with information about the
task to perform like this:

<a name="startform">
<form action=#startform method=get>

<table border=1 align=center>

<tr>
<th colspan=3>Task #: Task Name</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Input (Required Items)</th>
<th>Logic or Aids</th>
<th>Output or Action</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><ul><li><a href="#">Tracy's Item</a></ul></td> <td><ul><li>Skim
the item<li>Assess the subject area<li>Pick two reviewers that are experienced
in that area</ul></td>
<td>
Comment:<br>
<textarea rows=5 cols=30></textarea>

<ul><li><input type=submit value="Start task"><p>
<li><input type=submit value="Comment only"></ul></td>
</tr>

<!--

<tr>
<th colspan=3>Resources assigned to task</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan=3><ul><li>Resource<li>Resouce</ul></td>
</tr>

-->

<tr>
<th colspan=3>Journal</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan=3><ul><li>Case started on MM/DD/YYYY</ul></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th colspan=3>Extreme Actions</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan=3><ul><li><input type=submit value="Discontinue this case"></ul></td>
</tr>

</table>

</form>
</a>

Mike Moderator decides to work on this task and clicks the Start task
button. The output pane now changes to look like this:

<a name="finishform">
<form action=#finishform method=get>
<table border=1 align=center>
<th>Output or Action</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Comment:<br>
<textarea rows=5 cols=30></textarea>
<p>
Reviewer 1: <select name=a><option>-- Please select --</option></select>
<p>
Reviewer 2: <select name=b><option>-- Please select --</option></select>

<ul><li><input type=submit value="Finish task"><p>
<li><input type=submit value="Comment only">
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><input type=submit value="Cancel task">
</ul></td>
</tr>
</table>
</form>
</a>


<p>

At the same time, the task dissappears from the other moderators' work
lists. Mike Moderator does his work and picks two reviewers, then hits
"Finish task". This pushes the case to the next step, which will add
two tasks, one for each reviewer, to review the item.

<p>

Randy Reviewer and Rick Reviewer will do essentially the same thing as
Mike Moderator: They'll receive an email that there's stuff for them
to review, go to the task page info page to see what to do, and do
their jobs. Their "action" pane will look like this:

<a name="finishform2">
<form action=#finishform2 method=get>
<table border=1 align=center>
<th>Output or Action</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Comment:<br>
<textarea rows=5 cols=30></textarea>
<p>
Review:<br>
<textarea rows=5 cols=30></textarea>
<p>
Conclusion: <select name=b>
<option>-- Please select --</option>
<option>Author must revise item</option>
<option>Ready for library</option>
<option>Should not be part of library at all</option>
</select>

<ul><li><input type=submit value="Finish task"><p>
<li><input type=submit value="Comment only">
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<li><input type=submit value="Cancel task">
</ul></td>
</tr>
</table>
</form>
</a>


The reviewer chooses "Author must revise item", which causes a new
task to be created for Tracy Techsupporter to revise her item. She
does, and when she says she's finished, new tasks are created for the
reviewers to re-review the item. This time, they're happy, and a task
is created for Charlie Categorizer to categorize the item. He does,
and the workflow ends with the item being included in the library.


<h3>VI.A Requirements: Engine and Model</h3>

There should be a <b>well-defined mathematical model</b> underlying
the workflows. Why? Because that's the best way we can ensure that the
workflow engine will have clear semantics. We will inevitably come to
face a situation where we're not certain how to interpret and act on a
given situation. The mathematical model will tell us.

<p>



<h4>Workflow</h4>

<ul>

<li><b>10.0 Routing Constructs</b>
<p>
The system must support the following forms of routing
<p>

<ul>

<li><b>10.1 Sequential Routing</b>
<p>
Two tasks are to be performed one after the other. This is the most
common routing construct in real-world workflows.
<p>


<li><b>10.2 Parallel Routing</b>
<p>
Two tasks are to be performed simultaneously or in no particular
order. This is essential for improving the throughput of a
workflow, since performing two tasks in parallel are likely to be
faster than performing them sequentially.

<p>

<li><b>10.3 Iterative Routing</b>
<p>
A set of tasks can be performed one or more times. The ticket-tracker
has an example of this routing, in that the ticket can go to "fixed,
awaiting approval" and back to "open" as many times as is necessary to
finally reolve and close the ticket.
<p>

<li><b>10.4 Conditional Routing</b>
<p>
One or another task is to be performed, depending on some
condition. This is often used to implement iterative routing, in that
the condition determines whether we should perform one more iteration
or not. Also, take approval of expenses as an example. It would be
common to make the approval process different, depending on the amount
in question, e.g. if it's a small amount, the applicant's supervisor
can approve the expense, or if it's a very large amount, both the CEO
and the chairman must approve it.
<p>

<li><b>10.4.1 Explicit and Implicit Condition Routing</b> 
<p>
The decision can be made either as we're finishing the prior task, or as we 
execute one of the two conditional tasks. The above example is one of explicit
conditional routing.  An example of Implicit conditioning, is a restaurant 
owner purchases perishable goods, such as meat and vegatables.  The food items 
sit in a queue waiting to be processed into meals or wait for 15 days (meat 
and vegatables tastes change after 15 days).  If the task "wait for 15 days"
 is completed, then the food item is thrown away.  The routing is determined by 
the first task to execute.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Tasks</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>40.0 Inputs</b>
<p>
The item that the workflow is about will always be part of the input,
but there should be the option of presenting other information. Static
text will do for now.
<p>

<li><b>50.0 Algorithms and work aids</b>
<p>
Each task will contain more detailed information on what is expected
to be done and instructions to the person executing the task on how to
go about executing it. Static text will do for now.
<p>

<li><b>60.0 Outputs</b>
<p>
A task can have a number of values as output. Examples include
"review_comments", "review_conclusions" as above. We should be able to
use these values in conditions for conditional routing.
<p>

<li><b>70.0 Transactional execution</b>
<p>
The execution of a task must be atomic to the system. Either the task
completes or it doesn't do anything. But in the real world, a task
takes time, so we must have a "start", "commit", "rollback"
meachanism.
<p>
<li>
<b>70.1</b> There should be a date, such that, if the user has stared,
but not committed or rolled back the task before that timeout date,
the task is automatically rolled back and the task is created again.
There should be a callback to calculate that date.
<p>


<li><b>80.0 Assignments</b>
<p>
Tasks are not assigned directly to users, instead we associate roles
with a task.  A role is granted to a single or a group of users.
Users belonging to that role have execute privileges on the task 
associated with role.
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Static assignment:</b> while defining the workflow

<li><b>Manual assignment:</b> assignment of tasks to users is part of the
workflow process, as in the user-scenario above.  Only users with the 
role associated with task are available for selection. 

<li><b>Programmatic assignment:</b> The assignment is made
automatically based on some condition, e.g. a category. It should be
done with a call-back in the RDBMS layer, so another package that uses
the workflow package can provide their own logic, without having to
use the same webserver as the workflow package might.
</ol>
<p>

<li><b>90.0 Prioritizing</b>
<p>
There should be some mechanism of prioritizing tasks in the work
list. How to do this is yet undefined. A call-back seems desirable,
but we need to determine when or how often the call-back should be
executed (i.e. how often will we allow priorities to change).
<p>
<b>90.1 Deadline</b>
<p>
Each task can have a deadline, a date by which is must be
performed. This is determined by a call-back as the task is created.
<p>
<b>90.5 Completion time </b> A task has an entry to estimate how long 
it will take for completion.

<p>

<b>Note: Defintion of deadline is unclear: is it per case or per task?
I.e., if a task is entered twice, will it have the same deadline both
times, or will it have a new deadline the second time around? Or
option of both?</b>
<p>


<li><b>100.0 Email notification</b>
<p>
The users should automatically be alerted when there's a new task for
them to perform.
<p>
<b>100.1</b> <b>Not fully specified: It should also alert them when the
deadline is nearing, when the priority changes, and possibly on other
conditions.</b>
<p>

<li><b>110.0 Side-effects</b>
<p>
There should be a callback mechanism allowing for side-effects at
certain points in time. 

<ol>

<h5>Required:</h5>

<li>When a new task arrives
<li>When a task is finished.
<li>When a task gets unassigned
<li>When a task is started
<li>When a task is finished (committed)
<li>When a task is canceled (rolled back)
<li>When a task times out and is canceled.

</ol>

<li><b>120.0 Automatic tasks</b>
<p>
A task can be "automatic" in the sense, that it is only there for the
side-effects. It is automatically finished as soon as it is created.
<p><b>120.1 Timed automatic tasks</b>
<p>
Alternatively, we can specify a
specific point in time, the automatic task should finish. This is
useful for timeouts, e.g. when waiting for a client to return a form,
we may cancel the case if we don't hear back within a month. The point
in time is determined via a call-back.

<p><b>120.5 Message tasks </b>
<p>A message from an external source can be passed to the task.  The task
is executed upon receiving the message and all the criteria placed on
the message are satisfied.

<li><b>125.0 Commentability</b>
<p>
The user can post a comment on a task at any time during
the life-cycle of the case . The comments are shown to the users,
so they can use them as a guidance in processing the case.
<p>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Contexts</h4>

<ul>

<li><b>130.0 Workflow Contexts</b>
<p>
The same workflow definition may be applied in several different
departments of the same company. In this case, the department will be
the <i>context</i> of the workflow. In other situations, the same
workflow definition may be applied within separate companies running
on the same site. In this case, the company is the context.


<p>

The things that are dependent on the context are:

<p>

<ul>
<li>Static assignment
<li>The number of minutes estimated to complete the task
<li>The side effect events that trigger a callback
<li>Roles associated with a task. 
</ul>

<p>

<b>Note! It may or may not be the case that a <i>context</i> will
always also be a <i>subsite</i>, in which case we don't need any
additional concept to model this situation. </b>
</ul>


<h3>VI.B Requirements: API</h3>

<h4>Controlling the Workflow Process</h4>

<ul>

<li><b>200.0 Start workflow</b>
<p>
Start a new instance of the workflow around an object. Currently 
it is not possible to have a callback in the kernel upon new 
object creation.  This requires programmically calling the
method to start a new case. 
<p>

<li><b>210.0 Cancel/Suspend/Resume workflow</b>
<p>
Cancel/suspend/resume the overall workflow process, e.g. if an
applicant backs out of the process, or the administrator decides the
processing must wait a while before continuing.
<p>

<li><b>220.0 Start/Finish/Cancel task</b>
<p>
The API must provide for starting/finishing/canceling tasks.
<p>
<b>220.1</b> Finishing
the task includes storing the output of the task in attributes
attached to the workflow instance.
<p>

<li><b>230.0 Workflow Attributes</b>
<p>
Attributes for a process to use for branching and keeping state
properties. 
<br><br><b>230.10 </b> Add and Edit attributes attributes per case
<br><br><b>230.20 </b> Access to those attributes values in the callback
 procedures
</ul>


<h4>Creating Workflows</h4>

<ul>

<li>API for defining workflows would be nice.

</ul>

<h3>VI.C Requirements: Web Interface for Interacting with the Workflow Process</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>300.0 Work list</b>
<p>
The user should have a work list page showing all the tasks he's
supposed to perform. It should be ordered by priority/deadline. 

<p>

<li><b>310.0 Task information and management</b>
<p>
See the user-scenario for a sample page.
<p>


<li><b>320.0 Workflow overview</b>
<p>
A page where you can get an overview of how a particular workflow is
going overall, i.e., how all the workflow instances are doing. It's
tough to come up with a good visual design of this that will give the
quick overview. <b>Needs to be thought more about. Probably not a
first version thing</b>.

<p>

</ul>


<h3>VI.D Requirements: Web Interface for Defining Workflows</h3>


<ul>

<li><b>400.0 Simple Process Wizard</b> <br><br>
Step by step directions for creating a new workflow process. 
Do not expose process designer to more advance features such
as addition parallel routing. 
<p>
<li><b>410.0 Advanced Process Builder</b><br>
Exposes all the glory details of each entity within the workflow. 
</ul>
