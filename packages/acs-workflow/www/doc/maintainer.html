This document is about the internal details of the workflow package,
aimed at developers maintaining the package.


<h3>System Overview</h3>

The workflow package consists of five major components:

<p>

<strong>The Engine is the heart of the system</strong>. It's the part that determines
what actions you can perform on a case, and keeps track of the state
of the case as actions are performed. It also stores the process
definitions and the state of all the cases on the system.

<p>

<strong>The Worklist is what the normal end-user sees</strong>. It's
where the user goes to see the list of tasks he or she is assigned to,
and interacts with the system to let us know he's done.

<p>

The <strong>Process Builder</strong> lets you define and share
processes. The <strong>Process Adapter</strong> lets you customize
assignments and special side-effects of your process to your
situation. And finally, the <strong>Process Monitor</strong> lets you
monitor the performance of a process.



<h3>Transitions and Tasks</h3>

When a transition becomes enabled, a row representing the enabled
transition is inserted into <code>wf_tasks</code>. This table may have
more than one row per transition for a number of reasons. If the user
starts the task, then decides to cancel, a new row is inserted, as the
same transition becomes enabled again. If there's an iteration in the
workflow definition, so the same transition becomes enabled more than
once, a new row is inserted each time.

<p>

Each task has a state. It starts out as 'enabled'. It moves to
'started', then possibly to 'canceled' or 'finished' in response to
user actions. If the transition is part of an implicit or-split (where
two transitions share one input place), the task may become
'overridden' if the other task is triggered.



<h3>Assignments</h3>

Assignments can be done in three different ways:

<ol>

<li><b>Programmatic:</b> You supply a callback to do the
assignment. The callback will get called when the transition becomes
enabled. Put the name of your callback in the
<code>assignment_callback</code> column in
<code>wf_context_transition_info</code>.

<p>

<li><b>Manual:</b> Assignment for one case. This is implemented as
rows in <code>wf_case_assignments</code>. You're encouraged to use the
API: <code>workflow_case.add_manual_assignment</code> and
<code>workflow_case.clear_manual_assignments</code>.

<p>

<li><b>Static:</b> Fixed assignment for all cases of a given
workflow. This is implemented as rows in
<code>wf_context_assignments</code> table.

</ol>

The actual assignment occurs when the transition is enabled. At that
point, a row is inserted into <code>wf_tasks</code> and the actual
assignment is determined, and copied over into
<code>wf_task_assignments</code>. The logic is this: 

<p>

<ol>

<li>First, we see if there are any manual assignments in
<code>wf_case_assignments</code>. If there is, we copy these over to
<code>wf_task_assignments</code>.  (We used to check for a callback
first, but this way if a task is reassigned, the reassignment persists
for subsequent instances of the transition.)

<p>

<li>If there are no manual assignments and a callback is registered,
that callback procedure is executed, and is expected to use the
<code>workflow_case.add_task_assignment</code> API to add the actual
assignment for this task.

<p>

<li>Otherwise, we resort to the static assignment by copying over the
rows from <code>wf_context_assignments</code> to
<code>wf_task_assignments</code>.

</ol>

<p>

In every event, a number of rows are created in
<code>wf_task_assignments</code>. This is the authoritative version of
who's assigned to this task. You're free to change the assignment of a
task by altering the contents of
<code>wf_task_assignments</code> through the API or directly.  If you
use the workflow UI, this change will be persistent.  However, if you
don't want reassignment to persist in your application, changing
<code>wf_task_assignments</code> alone will accomplish this.

<p>

The view <code>wf_user_tasks</code> returns one row per task and per
user assigned to a task. This is the view to query to get the list of
tasks on a user's plate, and to get information about assignments for
a task. It does the job of traversing the parties hierarchy to expand
groups.



<h3>User Actions</h3>

Users can start, cancel and finish tasks. Since you can set workflow
attributes as part of an action, for each of these actions, you have
to make the following sequence of API calls:

<ol>

<li><code>workflow_case.begin_task_action</code>

<li><code>workflow_case.set_attribute_value</code> zero or more times.

<li><code>workflow_case.end_task_action</code>

</ol>

(We would just accept a list of key/value pairs for the attributes,
but we couldn't figure out a way to do that with PL/SQL).

<p>

The <code>action</code> argument to the procs are 'start', 'cancel',
'finish' or 'comment'. Comment doesn't alter the state of the task,
and can be used for either adding a comment on the case, and/or to set
a workflow attribute without finishing the task.

<p>

It's perfectly okay to finish a task without explicitly starting
it. If there are multiple users assigned to the same task, however,
it's strongly recommended that the user starts the task first, as that
will remove it from the worklist of other users, so we don't have
multiple users working on the same task.


<h3>Data Model Changes</h3>

Whenever there's a data model change, don't forget to propagate that
change to:

<ul>

<li>The <code>sql/wf-core-drop.sql</code> DDL script.

<li>The <code>sql/upgrade/*.sql</code> DDL upgrade scripts.

<li>The <code>tcl/workflow-procs.tcl</code> file, proc
<code>wf_export_workflow</code> (at the bottom).

<li>... and of course any UI pages that are affected must be changed
too.

</ul>
