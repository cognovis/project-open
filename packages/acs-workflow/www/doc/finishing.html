<h2>Workflow Finishing Proposal</h2>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

The workflow package isn't very useful as a stand-alone package. It's
intended to be deployed by some application. We won't fully understand
the requirements for the workflow package until we have a pilot
application to develop on top of workflow.

<p>

I propose that we designate such a pilot application and the resources
to develop it alongside developing the workflow package. We should
also agree that we have Brian avaiable to for business questions as we
go along.


<h3>Feature List</h3>

This is the list of requirement/features that I've already
identified. The time estimates are in ideal developer days, and very
rough, since most of the features aren't very well defined yet. We'll
close on the definitions in cooperation between marketing and
development.

<p>

In addition to the list below, I'm expecting especially the end-user
UI to get extended as we learn more about the real-life requirements.

<td>Handling Unassigned Task</td>
<td>We need a way to handle unassigned tasks. Either a place where they can be picked up my an uber-user, have them automatically assigned to some person, and/or spamming some person. This ties in to deciding under what circumstances you're allowed to "pass the buck", i.e. assign a task to someone else, and if so, to whom you can assign it. This ties in to permissions, too.</td>

about the internals of the workflow engine. This UI has already been mostly done by Matthew. </td>

useful.</td>

<tr bgcolor=#eeeeee>

behave as they expect, they'll need to have a UI for investigating
what happened and why.</td>

<td>Workflow Maintaner UI</td>
<td>This is related to the "static assignments UI". It's similar to
APM, only for workflows. It would allow you to package up your
workflow definition in some redistributable form, as well as install a
workflow definition from such a file.</td>
