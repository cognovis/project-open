This document lists areas for future development of the workflow package.

<p>

All the existing features and UIs will be continually improved to
better serve users' needs. But there are also entirely new areas that
we're planning to explore. These are:

<ul>

<li><strong>Extension with color.</strong> By letting tokens carry
values themselves, we can implement parallel routing without a
predetermined number of concurrent threads of execution. Color is a
standard extension of Petri Nets, and thus straight-forward to
implement in that all the hard work of defining the semantics have
already been done by others. The most likely implementation is to have
each token carry a XML document, the places carry a DTD, which must be
the DTD of tokens residing in that place, and arcs perform XSLT
transformations on the tokens.

<p>

<li><strong>Extension with hierarchy.</strong> Hierarchy is another
one of the standard Petri Net extensions that make excellent sense for
workflow nets. Each task can consist of a number of sub-tasks. The
interface between the levels are well-defined, in the form of places
that exist on both levels. The hierarchy can be arbitrarily deep.

<p>

<li><strong>Analysis of workflows.</strong> At a minimum we'll want a
way to ensure that a workflow net is well-constructed, i.e. no
deadlocks, we can't end up in inconsistent states, such as "workflow
is not finished but there are no tasks to perform either", etc. But
more importantly, the underlying model we're using (Petri nets) lends
itself very easily to simulation and analysis of performance and
throughput, discover bottlenecks, and lots of other interesting
features of workflows. The analysis can both be on simulated data and
on historic data.

<p>

<li><strong>Cooperation with other systems.</strong> The workflow
package should integrate with other software, including other workflow
management systems. We're investigaing and evaluating the existing
standards in the field, especially <a href="http://www.wfmc.org/">WfMC</a>.

<p>

<li><strong>Separate task manager package.</strong> It makes sense to
separate the task list into its own PIM-style task manager package,
so we're expecting to do that.

<p>

<li><strong>Engine written in Java</strong>. The next-generation
workflow engine will probably be written in Java, to run inside a Java
application server or perhaps an EJB container. Thus, actions and
other forms of callbacks can be implemented as JavaBeans or EJBs,
providing for a much cleaner environment. We're currently
investigating the technology options.

<p>

<li><strong>Process and Callback Repository</strong> As the workflow
package gains in popularity, we'll host a process and callback
repository, so you can share and get access to processes and callbacks
without having to write them yourself. This will be facilitated
by an XML representation of a process, as well as by callbacks written
as JavaBeans or EJBs rather than PL/SQL functions/packages.

<p>

<li><strong>Manually manipulate the state of a case.</strong> We're
planning on providing a web-based interface for manually manipulating
the state of a case. The simplest form is undoing actions on a
case. The more advanced form is to let an administrator put the case
into any valid state.

<p>

<li><strong>Leverage an automated form-builder system.</strong> Once
the ACS has a fully functional automated form-generating subsystem in
place, we'll want to use it for generating more complex forms to fill
in workflow attributes or, when that time comes, values to be carried
by the tokens.

</ul>
