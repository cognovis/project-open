Who should read this? The manager or developer who need to define a
complex workflow process to use in his business or software
application.

<p>

<h3>The Conceptual Model</h3>

Think of workflows in terms of an <strong>'old-fashioned'
office</strong>, where all the employees has a desk with an inbox
sitting on it. The <strong>workflow engine is the attendant</strong>
that puts a form in their inbox saying what needs to be done while
tapping them on the shoulder to let them know they're on. When they're
done, the workflow engine finds out what the next tasks are and takes
the project on to the employees responsible.



<h3>What is a Workflow?</h3>

A workflow is the <strong>formal definition of the process</strong>
used to manage cases of a specific kind (e.g. order fulfillment,
article publishing). Each kind of case will have its own workflow
process. Here's an example:

<p>

<table align=center>
<tr><td align=center>
<img src="order_wf.jpg" height=399 width=659 alt="Order Fulfillment Workflow">
</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center><small>Order Fulfillment Workflow (<a
href="order_wf.jpg" target=_new>open in separate window</a>)</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>

The definition of a workflows (what needs to be done to a case and in
what order), are formalized in terms of a computational model called
<a href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/PetriNets/" title="The main site for
Colored Petri Nets (CPN) research"><b>Petri nets</b></a>, and the
example above is indeed a Petri net. Let's walk through it and
explain it in detail.

<p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>circles</strong> are called <strong>places</strong> and
represent the <strong>inboxes</strong> in the office-metaphor.

<p>

<li>The <strong>rectangles</strong> are called
<strong>transitions</strong> and represent the <strong>tasks</strong>
to be performed.

</ul>

<strong>Places are inactive</strong>. All the places do is hold
<strong>tokens</strong> representing the state of the process. If, for
example, there's a token in place D above, then that means we're ready
to pack the order.

<p>

<strong>Transitions are active</strong>. They move tokens from their
<strong>input places</strong> (the places that has an arc pointing
into the transition) to their <strong>output places</strong> (the
places you get to by following the arcs going out of the
transition). When this happens, the transition is said to
<strong>fire</strong>.

<p>

Transitions can only when there's <strong>at least one token in each
input place</strong>. When that is the case, the transition is
<strong>enabled</strong>. That the transition is
<strong>enabled</strong> means it is <strong>able to fire</strong>. 

<p>

The time the transition is enabled and the time it fires are
different. The thing that causes an enabled transition to fire is
called <strong>trigger</strong>.

<p>

There are four diffent types of triggers:

<ul>

<li>Most transitions will normally be performed by a person. This is
called a <strong>user trigger</strong> and is symbolized with a fat
arrow pointing to the task.

<p>

<li>Some tasks, such as the user updating his billing information, are
beyond the control of the workflow software. The workflow software
receieves a message that the task has been performed, and thus these
are called <strong>message trigger</strong>, symbolized with an
envelope.

<p>

<li>Transitions with an <strong>Automatic trigger</strong> are
performed by the system as soon as the transition is enabled. The
'Spam Customer' task above is such a transition. When fired, it will
execute some code to send off the email to the user. All other
transitions can also execute application-specific code when they fire.

<p>

<li>Some automatic transitions need to occur at a certain point in
time. The 'Cancel Order' transition above has a <strong>time
trigger</strong>, symbolized with a stop watch, which will
automatically cancel the order if the user hasn't gotten back to us
with updated billing information within, say, three weeks.

</ul>


<h3>Routing</h3>

When the workflow is started, a token is placed in the <strong>start
place</strong> (A in the example). This enables the automatic
transition 'Charge Credit Card'. 

<p>

The transition fires with a succes or a failure. If it was
successful, it produces a token in place D. If there was a failure, it
produces a token in place B. Thus, the outcome of the attempt at
charging the credit card governs the further routing of the process.

<p>

<blockquote>The rule is that firing a token <strong>consumes one
token from each of its input places, and places a token on each of its
output places, for which the guard is true</strong>.</blockquote>

<p>

The <strong>guard</strong> is a predicate, in this case the
<code>[success]</code> and <code>[failure]</code> on the arcs going
out of 'Charge Credit Card'. Guards are what enables us to do
<strong>conditional routing</strong>. The 'Charge Credit Card'
transition acts as an <strong>or-split</strong>, because it chooses
either one route or the other.

<p>

The above form of or-split is called an <strong>explicit</strong>
or-split. There's another form of conditional routing, which is the
<strong>implicit or-split</strong> that chooses between the
transitions 'Update Billing Information' and 'Cancel Order'. Since
there's only one token in place C, only one of the two transitions can
have it. But, contrary to the explicit or-split, where the decision is
explicitly made as soon as 'Charge Credit Card' finishes, the choice
between 'Update Billing Information' and 'Cancel Order' is made as
late as possible.

<p>

Both transitions will be enabled when there's a token in place C
(i.e. when the spam has been sent). If the user updates his billing
information before the timed 'Cancel Order' transition times out,
'Cancel Order' is never fired. And vice versa: If the order is
canceled (which will probably involve spamming the user again to let
him know that his order was canceled), then he won't be able to update
his billing information and will have to enter a new order. Thus, the
choice is made implicitly, based on the timing.

<p>

The guard will generally depend on <strong>case
attributes</strong>. The 'Charge Credit Card' transition above will
set a case attribute to either 'success' or 'failure', and the guard
will check this value to determine its result. Case attributes can
hold more complex values than simple yes/no values, but the guard must
always be either true or false.

<p>

The workflow package also handles <strong>parallel routing</strong>,
where two or more things happen concurrently or in no particular
order. This is done by having a transition produce more tokens than it
consumes, which is called an <strong>and-split</strong>. To
re-synchronize execution with a transition that waits for both
concurrent threads to finish before it continues. This is called an
<strong>and-join</strong> and is simply a transition that consumes
more tokens than it produces.



<h3>User Tasks</h3>

An enabled user transition is called a <strong>user
task</strong>. 

<p>

The user tasks must be <strong>assigned to one or more users or
groups</strong>. This can be determined once and for all, e.g. the
shipping department is responsible for shipping. It may also be done
by hand for a specific case, e.g. the article on environmental
pollution should be written by Jimmy, who knows everything about
pollution. Or it can be done automatically, e.g. bugs are
automatically assigned to the user responsible for the product the bug
was found in. 

<p>

When a user is assigned to a task, the task will show up on the users
worklist. From here, the user can pick a task to work on, and mark it
started. This removes the task from the worklist of other assigned
users, so the task won't get executed twice. 

<p>

Often, the task will have an output. In the 'Pack' transition, for
example, the user is supposed to say whether the package is complete
or not. This is set as a case attribute and used for branching in the
or-split.

<p>

Not until the user finishes the task does the transition actually get
fired. The user may also choose to cancel the task, in which case the
task will re-appear on other users' work list.


<h3>Summary</h3>

That's what there is to it. If you're a workflow manager, you should
now be able to start formalizing your own workflow. If you're a
developer, you should read the <a href="developer">Workflow
Developer's Guide</a> to learn how to use this with your own package.
