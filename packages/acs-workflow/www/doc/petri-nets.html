A workflow-net or Petri net is essentially like a finite state
machine. There are states (although in Petri nets, they're called
places), and there are transitions between them. Places are depicted
as circles and transitions are depicted as rectangles.

<p>

So what's different? An instance of a FSM is always in exactly one
<b>state</b>, modeled by the presence of a token in that state. In
Petri nets, there can be <b>more than one token</b>. The overall
"state" of the Petri net (in the general computer-science sense of the
word "state") is the distribution of tokens in the places (called the
<b>marking</b>). That's why they're not called states anymore.

<p>

Arcs between transitions and places define the <b>input places</b> and <b>output
places</b> of the transition. All places with an arc pointing into a
transition is an input place for that transition. All places with arc
pointing from a transition to the place is an output place for that
transition.

<p>

In an FSM, when the transition fires, it moves the one token from one
state to another. In a Petri net, it consumes exactly one token in
each of its input places and produces one token in each of its output
places. Thus, the number of tokens before and after a transition fires
need not be the same. 

<p>

It's important to differentiate between the time a transition is
<b>enabled</b> (meaning it's ready to fire) and the time it actually
<b>fires</b>. A transition is enabled when there is at least one token
in each of its input places. Firing the transition is the act of
actually moving the tokens.

<p>

</tr><tr>
  <td align=center><font size=-1>AND-split</font></td>
  <td align=center><font size=-1>AND-join</font></td>
</tr></table>

<p>

This is used to model <b>parallel routing</b>, where one or more
transitions happen simultaneously or in no particular order. A
transition that consumes one token and produces two or more is called
an <b>and-split</b>, and the transition that consumes two tokens and
produces one is called an <b>and-join</b>, and is used to
re-synchronize the workflow after all of the parallel activities are
done.

<p>

While FSMs do support <b>conditional routing</b>, they can't
differentiate between the <b>time of choice</b> between the possible
transitions. Petri nets support <b>explicit or-splits</b>, where the
choice is made as soon as the previous transition has fired, and
<b>implicit or-splits</b> where the choice is simply made by letting
the transition that fires first win.

<p>

<table align=right><tr>
  <td align=center><img src="explicit-or-split.gif" width=113 height=99 alt="Explicit OR-split"></td>
  <td align=center><img src="implicit-or-split.gif" width=115 height=103 alt="Implicit OR-split"></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td align=center><font size=-1>Explicit OR-split</font></td>
  <td align=center><font size=-1>Implicit OR-split</font></td>
</tr></table>

<p>

To support <b>explicit or-splits</b> we introduce <b>guards</b>. A
guard is an expression attached to an arc that must return either true
or false. Only if the expression evaluates to true can tokens travel
over the arc. Thus if there are two arcs going out of a transition,
each with guards that are mutually exclusive (although they need not
be), only the arc whose guard evaluates to true will produce a token
in its place.

<p>


An <b>implicit or-split</b> is modeled by having two arcs going out of
the same place. Since the transition that fires first gets the token,
and there will be no token for the other transitions to consume. Thus,
even though they were enabled up until the point when the first
transition fired, the others will not fire.

<h3>Margin Note: Why Petri Nets?</h3>

Petri Nets are a very simple mathematical model. It is a graphical
language, yet the semantics are clear. There's essentially just one
rule of action, which is the rule of how transitions are enabled and
fire.

<p>

The Petri Net model has been around for many years and has been used
extensively in simluation and verification of network protocols, a
subject that is very like workflows in many ways. Therefore, it comes
as no surprise that the concepts used in workflows maps onto Petri
Nets in a very straight-forward way. If you're interested in reading
more about this, <a href="http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wsinwa/">W.M.P. van
der Aalst</a> has written an excellent paper, entitled <a
href="http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wsinwa/jcsc/jcsc.html"><i>The
Application of Petri Nets to Workflow Management</i></a>. Or, if
you're lazy, you might want to <a
href="http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wsinwa/jcsc/node24.html">just read the
conclusion</a> of the paper.

<p>

Being mathematically well-founded brings many benefits. Some of the
benefits of using Petri Nets are:

<ul>

<li><b>Verification:</b> It is easy to verify properties of Petri
Nets, e.g. that all executions lead to the desired result, regardless
of how it may execute.

<li><b>Simulation:</b> It is easy to simulate several executions,
which will help identify possible bottlenecks and estimate both
overall throughput and the execution time of the individual case.

</ul>

These are prime reasons Petri Nets are so heavily used in modeling
network protocols, and workflows benefit in the same way.

<p>

Moreover, some of the common extensions to classical Petri Nets make
immediate sense when applied to workflows:

<ul>

<li><b>Time:</b> For workflows, it is almost always important to know
the durations and delays during execution, in order to optimize
throughput and the time of the individual case.

<li><b>Hierarchy:</b> It is a common structuring mechanism in
workflows to define a task in terms of subtasks. The same is the case
in Petri Nets, which have been extended in a straight-forward and
mathematically well-founded way with hierarchy.

<li><b>Color:</b> Remember the papers and inbox-metaphor above? Color
is the things you scribble on the individual piece of paper. Colored
Petri Nets associate attributes with the individual token. This is
something you often want to do in real-world workflows, i.e., people
do scribble things on the papers in the inbox-metaphor, and it adds to
the expression power of the workflow. It is commonly used in network
protocol simulation and, of course, mathematically well-founded.

</ul>
