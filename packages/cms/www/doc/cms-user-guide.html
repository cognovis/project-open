    that specify the format and layout of the finished page. A template
    is a text file consisting largely of static text and markup such as
    HTML, WML, SGML or XML. The template also has strategically
    positioned placeholders dictating the position of content
    attributes and data.</P
><P
>There are two basic types of templates:</P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Templates associated with specific content types. The template
	contains placeholders for each attribute associated with a content
	item of that type. For example, the template for a news story may
	contain placeholders for a title, byline, image, and the body of
	the story. The template may also incorporate other related dynamic
	data, such as lists of related links or information such as stock
	quotes, pricing or inventory.</P
><P
>A content type may be associated with multiple templates,
	enabling publishers and users to choose the presentation of each
	item individually depending on context, device or any other
	criteria.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Templates associated with individual pages. The template is
	applied only to a specific page on the site. Typically these pages
	display summary information, such as top-level pages that list the
	title and description of recent content added to the site. These
	pages may also be highly personalized, providing links to relevant
	content or displaying specific data based on a user's profile and
	preferences.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>Production templates are stored in the file system under a
    special directory known as the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>template root</I
>. Additional
    directories may exist under the template root to further organize
    the entire set of templates used by a site.</P

      and deployment of templates:</P
><P
><B
CLASS="phrase"
>Organization.</B
> Templates may be organized into folders,
      reflecting their location under the template root once they go into
      production. Since the templates are never viewed directory from a
      public server, this organization does not necessarily correspond to
      what is specified in the site map.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="phrase"
>Versioning.</B
> Before templates go into production, drafts
      are stored in the database. A full revision history is maintained,
      enabling designers or managers to track changes and revert to
      previous versions.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="phrase"
>Data Dictionary.</B
> Designers may review the data sources
      available to a template, so they know the set of valid placeholders
      to embed in the markup.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="phrase"
>Asset Management.</B
> Templates may include static references
      to graphics, sounds, animation or other media assets that are also
      managed with CMS. Designers and managers can view and manage asset
      dependencies for a template.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="phrase"
>Deployment.</B
> The live version of a template is always
      written to the file system, from where the system may use it for
      publishing to either the file system or directly to clients.</P

TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
><B
CLASS="phrase"
>Information design.</B
> The first step is to decide on the
	  information that the template will present.</P
><P
>For a reusable template applicable to any item of a particular
	  type, this may include the following:</P
><UL
><LI
><P
CLASS="listitem"
>The body of the content item.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
CLASS="listitem"
>Attributes of the content item, such as the author, title and
	      publication date.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
CLASS="listitem"
>Links to related items.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
CLASS="listitem"
>Keywords and other metadata for inclusion in the META tags of
	      the document.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>For individual page templates, the information may be anything.
	  Index pages may query for the latest items publishing in a section,
	  or for featured items previously selected by the publishing
	  team.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><B
CLASS="phrase"
>Implement data sources.</B
> The product of the information
	  design step is a list of <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>data sources</I
>. A data source is
	  typically a database query, but may be modified or created in
	  procedural code as well (see the templating system documentation
	  for details).</P
><P
>The data sources are implemented in a Tcl script that must
	  reside in the directory where the template is written when
	  published. CMS does not currently provide any UI for management of
	  the Tcl scripts. This must be done with CVS.</P
><P
>The developer should document each data source using the
	  documentation directives provided by the templating system. CMS
	  parses these directives and presents the documentation to the
	  designer in the UI.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><B
CLASS="phrase"
>Write template.</B
> The first simple prototype of the
	  template itself is typically written by the developer for the
	  purpose of debugging the Tcl script. The developer may create this
	  file in the file system, and then use the CMS UI to read it into
	  the repository as the first revision of the template.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	<B
CLASS="phrase"
>Revise template.</B
> Once the initial version of the template
	  is created, the designer may either edit the template in the
	  browser, or more likely, download the template and edit it in a
	  client editor and then upload it again to test.

TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>The majority of the pages in the site are dedicated to
	displaying the body and attributes of individual content items or
	small logical collections of items, such as the photos on an album
	page.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>In addition to the content pages themselves, publishers must
	implement index pages to provide context for the content of the
	site. These top-level pages provide an interface for searching and
	navigating among the sections of the site and for reaching recent
	or featured content. Besides index pages, the site may also have
	special pages without a direct relationship to content.</P
><P
>In order to be represented in the site map and managed in a
	consistent fashion, top-level and special pages must also be
	represented as content items. In the simplest case, the content
	type of these items may just be a Basic Item. This is appropriate
	because these pages typically possess little if any content or
	special attributes of their own, acting merely as containers for
	presenting aggregated summary information. If the top-level pages
	of your site do possess special attributes, or if you wish to
	constrain the relations on those pages, then you can also employ a
	subtype.</P

	  its position within the hierarchical organization of the
	  repository. The URL is simply composed of the name of the item
	  preceded by the names of all its parent items.</P
><P
>One major difference from a file system is that the URL includes
	  <I
