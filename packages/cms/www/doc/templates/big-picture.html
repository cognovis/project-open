<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Content is published by merging data with <I CLASS="emphasis">templates</I>
    that specify the format and layout of the finished page. A template
    is a text file consisting largely of static text and markup such as
    HTML, WML, SGML or XML. The template also has strategically
    positioned placeholders dictating the position of content
    attributes and data.</P>

<P>There are two basic types of templates:</P>

<OL TYPE="1">
  <LI><P>Templates associated with specific content types. The template
	contains placeholders for each attribute associated with a content
	item of that type. For example, the template for a news story may
	contain placeholders for a title, byline, image, and the body of
	the story. The template may also incorporate other related dynamic
	data, such as lists of related links or information such as stock
	quotes, pricing or inventory.</P>
      <P>A content type may be associated with multiple templates,
	enabling publishers and users to choose the presentation of each
	item individually depending on context, device or any other
	criteria.</P></LI>

  <LI><P>Templates associated with individual pages. The template is
	applied only to a specific page on the site. Typically these pages
	display summary information, such as top-level pages that list the
	title and description of recent content added to the site. These
	pages may also be highly personalized, providing links to relevant
	content or displaying specific data based on a user's profile and
	preferences.</P></LI>
</OL>

<P>Production templates are stored in the file system under a
    special directory known as the <I CLASS="emphasis">template root</I>. 
    Additional directories may exist under the template root to further 
    organize the entire set of templates used by a site.</P>

<H3 CLASS="sect3"><A NAME="templates-tool-summary">Tool Summary</A></H3>

<P>CMS includes a set of basic tools for managing the production
      and deployment of templates:</P>

<P><B CLASS="phrase">Organization.</B> Templates may be organized into folders,
      reflecting their location under the template root once they go into
      production. Since the templates are never viewed directory from a
      public server, this organization does not necessarily correspond to
      what is specified in the site map.</P>

<P><B CLASS="phrase">Versioning.</B> Before templates go into production, 
      drafts are stored in the database. A full revision history is maintained,
      enabling designers or managers to track changes and revert to
      previous versions.</P>

<P><B CLASS="phrase">Data Dictionary.</B> Designers may review the data sources
      available to a template, so they know the set of valid placeholders
      to embed in the markup.</P>

<P><B CLASS="phrase">Asset Management.</B> Templates may include static 
      references to graphics, sounds, animation or other media assets that 
      are also managed with CMS. Designers and managers can view and manage 
      asset dependencies for a template.</P>

<P><B CLASS="phrase">Deployment.</B> The live version of a template is always
      written to the file system, from where the system may use it for
      publishing to either the file system or directly to clients.</P>

<H3 CLASS="sect3">

</H3>

<P>The typical process of developing a template for use with CMS is
      as follows:</P>

<OL TYPE="1">
  <LI><P><B CLASS="phrase">Information design.</B> The first step is to decide
          on the information that the template will present.</P>
      <P>For a reusable template applicable to any item of a particular
	  type, this may include the following:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI><P CLASS="listitem">The body of the content item.</P></LI>
        <LI><P CLASS="listitem">Attributes of the content item, such as the 
              author, title and publication date.</P></LI>
        <LI><P CLASS="listitem">Links to related items.</P></LI>
        <LI><P CLASS="listitem">Keywords and other metadata for inclusion in 
              the META tags of the document.</P></LI>
      </UL>
      <P>For individual page templates, the information may be anything.
	  Index pages may query for the latest items publishing in a section,
	  or for featured items previously selected by the publishing
	  team.</P></LI>
  <LI><P><B CLASS="phrase">Implement data sources.</B> The product of the 
          information design step is a list of <I CLASS="emphasis">data 
          sources</I>. A data source is
	  typically a database query, but may be modified or created in
	  procedural code as well (see the templating system documentation
	  for details).</P>
      <P>The data sources are implemented in a Tcl script that must
	  reside in the directory where the template is written when
	  published. CMS does not currently provide any UI for management of
	  the Tcl scripts. This must be done with CVS.</P>
      <P>The developer should document each data source using the
	  documentation directives provided by the templating system. CMS
	  parses these directives and presents the documentation to the
	  designer in the UI.</P></LI>
  <LI><P><B CLASS="phrase">Write template.</B> The first simple prototype of 
          the template itself is typically written by the developer for the
	  purpose of debugging the Tcl script. The developer may create this
	  file in the file system, and then use the CMS UI to read it into
	  the repository as the first revision of the template.</P></LI>
  <LI><P>&#13;	<B CLASS="phrase">Revise template.</B> Once the initial 
          version of the template is created, the designer may either edit the 
          template in the browser, or more likely, download the template and 
          edit it in a client editor and then upload it again to test.</P></LI>
</OL>

<H3 CLASS="sect3"><A NAME="templates-associating-templates-with-content-items">
  Associating Templates with Content Items</A></H3>

<P>&#13;      As mentioned earlier, templates can be associated with a 
      specific content type or an individual page (content item). In order to 
      associate a template to a specific content item, the template must first 
      be associated with that item's content type.</P>
