<a href="template.html">Templates Tutorial</a> : Publish Templates in CMS
<hr>

<h4>Overview</h4>

Developers can publish a template (.adp file) created in CMS to the filesystem.
The datasource files (.tcl files) associated with the templates (.adp files) 
should be maintained locally in the filesystem and ideally placed under 
version control.  <em>Currently, there is no way to edit datasources 
(.tcl files) using CMS although CMS can ascertain important information 
from the datasource files.</em> 


<h4>Step by Step</h4>

<ol>
  <li><p>Browse to the folder that contains the template to be published.</p>

  <li><p>Click the name of the template to bring up a page that displays
    the template's version history (see Figure 1). The History page contains
    a listing of revisions associated with the current template ordered from
    most recent to least recent.  The last revision to be published (if any) 
    is highlighted in yellow.  Note that if changes have been made to the last 
    published revision, then that version must be re-published in order 
    for those changes to be written to the filesystem.  This is why it is 
    always a good idea to save changes to the template as a new revision.</p>

    <p>Click the <img src="publish.gif" alt="Publish Template"> icon to 
    publish the template (.adp file) to the <tt>Template Root</tt> within the 
    filesystem.  Additionally, a version of the template can be re-published by
    clicking on the <img src="publish.gif" alt="Publish Template"> icon
    again.</p>
