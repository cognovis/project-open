      The Content Management System restricts access to registered users.
      Attempting to access a CMS page without having properly logged in will 
      automatically redirect the user to a sign-in page.

    <para>
      Content items are created either by entering text in a browser or 
      uploading files. In addition, an authorized user can add/edit
      extended attributes associated with the content item. Content items
      may also be edited by entering new text via a browser or uploading 
      new files.  Changes made to the content or extended attributes are 
      stored as revisions of the content item.

      Content may be previewed at any time (even before deployment) so long 
      as one revision is designated the Live Revision, the revision that will
      be previewed.
    </para>

    <para>
      Content can either be deployed immediately or scheduled for future 
      deployment (and expiration).  Before deployment, however, the 
      content item must satisfy the following preconditions:

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>One revision must be designated the Live Revision, the
	revision that will eventually be deployed.</simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>The content item must be in a publishable state.  The exact
	conditions for a content item being publishable will vary from item
	to item, depending on whether that item requires components to be 
	finished and whether that item has to pass through the production
	workflow.</simpara>
