      Permissions provide a way of answering the question, "may the user
      X perform some action Y on an object Z" ? The CMS UI provides forms
      for viewing and maintaining permissions, as well as a set of
      standard permissions which should be useful for web publishing
      applications. For a more complete description of the various
      permissions, see the <ulink url="../developer-guide/permissions.html">CMS developer guide</ulink>.

      To view permissions on folders, select the folder on the tree and
      click the "Folder Attributes" link. To view permissions on items,
      simply select the item in the folder and scroll down to the bottom
      of the page. In both cases, the permissions listing for the
      item/folder appears on the screen:

      To grant permissions to another user, mark the user on the
      clipboard and click "[ Grant ] more permissions to a marked user".
      You will only be allowed to grant permissions which you already
      possess, unless you have the "Modify Any Permissions" privilege.

      icon next to the user's name. The icon
      will not be visible unless you are allowed to edit permissions for that
      particular user.</para>

      In both cases, a permission editing form will appear on the screen:

    </screenshot>

    <para>
      The privileges are arranged on the form in a tree-like hierarchy;
      possession of a parent permission entails the possession of all of
      its child permissions, as well.  For example, a user with "Admin-level Read"
      would also have <emphasis>read</emphasis> access to anything 
      requiring "User-level Read."</para>
    
    <para>Check any permissions that you wish to grant to the user and uncheck any
      permissions that you wish to revoke. If you select "Yes" for the
      "Apply changes to child items and subfolders" option, your changes
      will affect the current item or folder, all the items in the
      folder, all subfolders of the folder, all the items in the
      subfolders, etc. If you select "No", only the current item or
      folder will be affected.</para>
    
    <para>Note that if you revoke a permission, all of its descendants
      will remain granted to the user. For example, if you revoke the
      "Admin-Level Read" permission from a user, the user will retain the
      "User-level Read" permission.</para>

    <para>Also note that you may not be able to modify some permissions on
      certain items; for example, you may not revoke somebody's
      "Administrator" permission if you yourself do not possess the
      "Administrator" permission on the item.</para>
