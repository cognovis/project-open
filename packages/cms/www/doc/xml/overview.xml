    <title>Setup and Customization</title>

    <para>CMS is designed to support content production without the
      regular intervention of a developer. Unless your publishing needs
      are extremely simple, however, a developer is required initially to
      set up and customize the system.</para>

    <sect3 id="overview-defining-content-types" xreflabel="Defining Content Types">
      <title>Defining Content Types</title>

      <para>The first step in the production process is to define the types
	of content that are relevant to a particular application. Examples
	of content types include Press Releases, News Stories, Images, and
	Product Reviews. A content type definition specifies what kinds of
	data may be associated with a content item of that type. This
	includes simple <emphasis>attributes</emphasis>, such as author, summary text,
	SKU number, etc., as well as valid <emphasis>associations</emphasis> with other
	content items, such as between news stories and images or
	graphics.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="overview-customizing-the-interface" xreflabel="Customizing the Interface">
      <title>Customizing the Interface</title>

      <para>Successful deployment of any content management system requires
	careful anticipation of the needs of the entire publishing team,
	including content producers, managers and any number of other
	staffpersons across the organization who may be monitoring the
	production and deployment process. The system must provide each
	class of users with an interface this is both intuitive and robust
	enough to provide access to all necessary functions.</para>

      <para>CMS includes a generic user interface designed to meet the basic
	needs of the majority of publishing teams. In recognition of the
	uniqueness of each organization, it is implemented in a highly
	modular fashion that simplifies the task of assembling customized
	interfaces. Common examples of customization include:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Simplified browsing interfaces that organize content in a
	    manner specific to a particular content type or categorization
	    scheme.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Information display panels that emphasize what is most
	    important or appropriate for the particular production
	    context.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Data entry forms and "wizards" to guide producers through a
	    specific task or related set of tasks.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Search pages tailored to the attributes of a specific set of
	    content types.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="overview-implementing-presentation-templates" xreflabel="Implementing Presentation Templates">
      <title>Implementing Presentation Templates</title>

      <para>In addition to implementing an appropriate interface for
	managing your content internally, you must implement templates that
	specify how content is presented to the public as part of your
	application. A <emphasis>presentation template</emphasis> is an HTML document
	with special placeholders indicating where content should be
	inserted, much like the templates used in a word processor to
	generate a form letter or other standard document. The
	implementation of presentation templates is typically a
	collaborative effort among publisher, developer and designer. The
	process is typically as follows:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem><para>You decide what information you want to present on a page. For
	    example, "This page has a news story as its centerpiece. On the
	    marging there is a list of related stories. The page may also
	    include one or two images."</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The developer implements the database queries to extract the
	    appropriate content from the database and make it available for
	    merging with the template. The developer may write a skeletal HTML
	    layout for the purpose of testing the queries.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The designer implements a layout for the page in HTML, possibly
	    based on the skeleton provided by the developer. The initial draft
	    may be a mockup for illustration purposes only.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The designer uses the documentation provided by the deveoper to
	    insert variable names in their proper position in the layout.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The developer and designer test the template with actual data
	    and revise as necessary.</para></listitem>

    <title>Data Production</title>

    <para>Data production is the everyday process by which producers enter
      content into the system, and managers edit, approve and deploy
      content to the public site.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="overview-deployment" xreflabel="Deployment">
    <title>Deployment</title>

    <para>CMS can coexist with your public server infrastructure in a
      variety of ways, ranging from total indepedence to tight
      integration.</para>

    <sect3 id="overview-static-content" xreflabel="Static Content">
      <title>Static Content</title>

      <para>Static content consists of pages that, once published, do not
	change unless edited manually. Examples of static content typically
	include Press Releases and News Stories. At the time of deployment,
	CMS can merge content with a presentation template and write it to
	the file system as a static HTML file. Your public server
	infrastructure can then deliver these pages to users without any
	further processing.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="overview-dynamic-content" xreflabel="Dynamic Content">
      <title>Dynamic Content</title>

      <para>Dynamic content consists of pages that are constantly changing
	as new content is deployed. These are typically "top-level" or
	summary pages that provide links to actual content. These pages
	must stay up-to-date without manual editing or intervention. For
	dynamic pages, you can query the content repository directly to
	ensure that the latest available content is always listed.
	Depending on your public server infrastructure, you may opt to
	cache this information and refresh it at regular brief intervals,
	rather than performing database queries for each user request.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="overview-personalization" xreflabel="Personalization">
      <title>Personalization</title>

      <para>Personalized pages are by necessity highly dynamic. As such,
	they invariably need to query the content repository directly to
	retrieve content appropropriate for the user who is making the
	request.</para>
    </sect3>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="overview-closing-the-loop" xreflabel="Closing the Loop">
    <title>Closing the Loop</title>

    <para>Monitoring usage trends is a critical final element to the
      production process. Publishers must continually adjust their
      content output to adapt to predominant user interests. Actual
      logging and reporting of user traffic is dependent on your public
      server infrastructure.</para>
