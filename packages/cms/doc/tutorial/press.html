<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate the basic process of
how CMS is deployed, including both developer preparation and the
content production process itself.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Support files for all demos are located in the <tt>demo</tt>
directory of the CMS distribution.  For this demo, you will need to
execute the <tt>press.sql</tt> script in the <tt>demo/sql</tt>
directory.  This script uses the content repository API to perform the
following actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new content type named "Press Release"
  <li>Add a custom attribute, <tt>location</tt>, to the "Press Release" 
  content type.
  <li>Specify that the user input for the <tt>location</tt> should be a 
  text box.
  <li>Create a few simple pages under the page root.
  <li>Create a folder named <tt>press</tt> to hold press releases.
  <li>Create a simple index page and a press release in the
      <tt>press</tt> folder.
  <li>Register a template as the default for the "Press Release" content type.
</ol>

<p>All these operations are (or will be) accessible through the CMS UI
as well.</p>
