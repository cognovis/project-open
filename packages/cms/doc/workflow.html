<h3>Workspace</h3>

<p>The default workspace displays a list of all current tasks.  Each
task is associated with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The title of a content item, linked to the information page for that
      item.
  <li>A "hold status" link.  If the item is checked out by the current user,
      the link is "Check In".  If the item is not checked out by the current
      user, the link is "Check Out".  If the item is checked out by
      another, the link is "Steal"
  <li>One or two "finish" links.  One "finish" link is "Approve",
      which moves the workflow to the next place.  (Ideally this will
      say "Finish" for the authoring step).  This links to an
      approval form, where the approver can make a comment.  The other
      link is "Reject", where the approver can make a comment and
      return the item back to a previous place (there may be more
      than one place).
  <li>If the user is assigned to it, she can finish the task even if 
      she has not checked it out, provided that no one else has it checked
      out.
</ul>
      
<h3>Editing Interface</h3>

<p>If the item is currently checked out by another user, there should
be a notice instead of any "Edit" links on the item information page.
The notice should link to a page that allows the user to "steal" the
lock from the other user (and send a notification).  The incident is
recorded as a journal entry for the event (use a comment action in the
workflow API).</p>
