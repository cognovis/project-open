From the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/files/specification.html">specification</a>,

<blockquote><em>
RDF Site Summary (RSS) is a lightweight multipurpose extensible
metadata description and syndication format. RSS is an XML
application, conforms to the W3C's RDF Specification and is extensible
via XML-namespace and/or RDF based modularization.
</em></blockquote>

This service package provides low-level support for generating and parsing RSS feeds.

<h3>1. Feed generation</h3>

Feed generation is the process of summarizing local content as RSS
xml.  To generate a feed we need to know
<ul>
<li> the site context whose content is to be summarized,
<li> how to retrieve the various required and optional metadata fields
<li> whether any changes have been made since the last summary was built
<li> how often to rebuild the summary (if changes are present)
</ul>

The last item is included with an eye toward performance.  In the
event that a particular summary is expensive to produce, we may opt
to rebuild at most every N minutes (or hours, or days).

<p>

<b>Usage scenarios</b>

<ul>

<li>Publisher wishes to syndicate the Bar Forum in the Foo Bboard package instance.

<li>Luckily, the bboard package implements the summary service
    contract for individual forums.

<li>Programmer registers the context identifier for the Bar Forum with
the summary service, indicating that the summary should be built no
more than once per hour.

<li>Summary is available at /some/url/specific/to/bar/forum/summary.xml

</ul>


<p>

<b>Service contract</b>

<p>

The feed generation service contract is called <code>RssGenerationSubscriber</code> and consists of two operations.

<ol>
<li><code>Datasource(summary_context_id)</code> returns a data
structure that contains all required metadata fields plus
configuration information such as the RSS version to be used (0.91 or
1.00 are supported at present).  This data structure contains
everything needed to run <code>rss_gen</code>.

<li><code>LastUpdated(summary_context_id)</code> returns a timestamp
that is used to determine if the live summary is out of date.  The
timestamp is given as the number of seconds since midnight on January
1, 1970, i.e. Unix time.
</ol>

<p>

<b>Under the hood</b>

<p>

<em>RSS files.</em>All summaries are static files.  They are served
from a static directory under the webroot specific by the
RssGenOutputDirectory, which defaults to <code>rss</code>.  The full
path to an RSS file is given by
<blockquote><pre>
/${RssGenOutputDirectory}/${ImplementationName}/${summary_context_id}/rss.xml
</pre></blockquote>

Note: we assume that <code>${ImplementationName}</code> and
<code>${summary_context_id}</code> contain OS- and URL-friendly
characters.

<p>

<em>Subscription.</em> A programmer registers a context with the
summary service through API functions (we can make it possible through
web UI as well if that makes sense).

<p>

<em>Summary context.</em> A summary context is a content-containing
domain which implements the summary service contract.  A summary
context is not identical to a package instance.  For example, a single
bboard package instance might contain 3 summary contexts, one for each
of the forums in the instance.  The summary context must, however,
be an acs_object for permissioning purposes (create a shell acs_object
if necessary).  Only one subscription is allowed per summary context.

<p>

<em>Service.</em> A scheduled proc runs through all subscribed
contexts, checking to see if the live summary is stale and also if the
minimum "quiet time" has elapsed.  If the conditions for rebuild are
met for a context, the scheduled proc pulls out the context's summary
data via <code>Datasource</code> and uses the information to build a
new summary page.  This generic and simple scheme can be used to
dispatch different versions of the summary builder as well as to
support extensibility via modules. <font color=red>Warning:</font>
This design expects the output of <code>Datasource</code> to be
reasonably small, as we will have to parse this list-of-lists to
generate a summary.
