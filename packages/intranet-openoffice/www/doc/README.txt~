You need to have properly installed openoffice-headless and jodconverter package in ubuntu.

Then copy openoffice.sh to /etc/init.d/openoffice. Make sure it starts correctly by issuing

sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/openoffice
sudo /etc/init.d/openoffice start

Then check jodconverter works




/usr/bin/jodconverter /
