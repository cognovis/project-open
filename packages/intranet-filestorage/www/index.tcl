    Shows a certain filestorage:

    By default shows the "Home"-Filestorage.

    @param file_id
	This option is used by the Full-Text Search.
    	The file_id refers to a file matching the search
	criteria. This page then shows the filestorage
	of the matching object.

    @param object_id
	Id of an object. The page shows the filestorage
	of the object if the current_user has the permissions
	to read the object.
	Then further permission restrictions apply to the
	filestorage folders.

    @param bread_crum_path
	Subdirectory where to start "opening" the FS


    Show the list of current task and allow the project
    manager to create new tasks.
