<h2>ACS Events Service Requirements</h2>

by W. Scott Meeks

<hr>

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

<p>
This document records the requirements for a new ACS Events
service package. This package is intended to provide basic
functionality which can be used in a consistent manner by other
service and application packages.  The events service
specifies relationships (possibly recurring) between a set of
time intervals time, an activity, and an arbitrary number of parties. An
activity can be associated with an arbitrary number of ACS objects.
</p>

<h3>II. Vision Statement</h3><p>

<p>
The ACS Events package will provide support for other services and
applications that require representing this sort of relationship
between time, parties, activities, and objects.  Such applications include
the generation of calendar objects, room reservations, event registration, and possibly
workflow.
</p>
<p>
The service needs to support recurring events.  Many
applications need to represent blocks of time within a given day that are
intended to be be repeated regularly on subsequent days.  The service should
support representing the most common types of recurrences: daily, weekly, monthly, et cetera.  It should
also provide for custom recurrences.
<p>
Having a single service for this functionality provides a number of
business advantages:
<ul>
<li>It saves work and increases quality; applications that deal with
time don't have to "re-invent the wheel" but instead can use a common,
tested code base.
<li>It improves consistency; the same API will be used in different
applications. 
<li>It simplifies integration; since a common data model is used to represent
events, different applications can more easily share related
information.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For example, the events service could support a room reservation
application that is integrated with an application which maintains users's personal and group calendars.  Suppose
Stephanie uses the room reservation application to reserve the Boston
1st floor conference room on 11/11 from 1pm to 2pm for Ern, Allen, and
Alan.  The events service will add a new event for this time
slot, add a mapping to Ern, Allen, and Alan, and an activity for the
meeting.  This activity will map to
the conference room.  Now to get a calendar item to appear on Ern,
Allen, and Alan's calendars, the reservation application can simply
pass the event to the calendar application which adds a mapping
between the activity and a new calendar item.
</p>

<h3>III. ACS Events Package Overview</h3>

<p>
There are four main areas of functionality in the events
package: events, time intervals, activities, and
recurrences.  The service depends upon the ACS object and parties systems.
</p>

<h4>III.A Events</h4>

<p>
An <b>event</b> is an activity associated with a temporal interval or
several such intervals. Events may have additional attributes as
well. Examples of events include: "hitchhiking from 4pm to 5pm",
"attending the InSync concert from 11pm to 1am at the Enormodome", et
cetera. Events are represented by designating the associated
activity together with a set of time intervals indicating when that
activity is to occur.
</p>
<p>
An event can optionally be mapped to a set of parties representing
groups or individuals that have some connection to the event.
</p>
<p>
The service provides an API for manipulating events.
</p>
<p>
An event is a relationship which maps parties and an activity to a set
of time intervals.  The relationship between a particular event can be
one to many with parties.  Time intervals can be open ended.
</p>
<p>
Activities contain a name, a description, and an optional link to
related information.  Ativites can be mapped one to many to ACS objects.  The
object mapped to a particular activity can be another activity or event.
</p>

<h4>III.B Time Interval Sets</h4>
<p>
A time interval set is a range of moments at which an event can
occur. A single time interval is of the form "from 3:00pm to 3:17pm
on 11/20/2000". A time interval set is of the form "from
3:00pm to 3:17pm and from 4:30pm to 4:45pm on 11/20/2000".  A
set of time intervals has two advantages: (i) it
allows for the representation of temporally gappy events such as
conferences, which end one day and pick up again the next, and (ii) if
implemented properly, it allows a simplification of the above account
of events, as now an event can be identified with a pair of an
activity together with a time interval set.
</p>
<p>
The service provides an API for manipulating time interval sets.
</p>

<h4>III.C Activities</h4>

<p>
An <b>activity</b> is a thing that a person or people do, usually represented
by a gerundic phrase, such as "biking", "reserving a room",
"travelling to Bhutan to achieve enlightenment", et cetera. Activities
are represented via a name and a description.  An activity can
optionally be mapped to a set of ACS objects.
</p>
The service provides an API for manipulating activities.
</p>

<h4>III.D Recurring Events</h4>

<p>
Consider an event, say, an activity A performed on day D at time T.   The ACS Events service allows applications to generate new events which are the same activity A performed on different days in the future, but at the same time of day T; such events are said to be <b>recurrences</b> of the primary event.  Recurrences can happen on a daily,
weekly, monthly, yearly or custom basis.  The start and end dates of
recurrences can be uniformly offset.
<p>
<h4>III.E Dependencies</h4>

<p>
The service depends on the ACS object model and on our parties system.  Event
is a subtype of acs_object.  The ACS Events service maps between the
event object, a time interval set, an activity, and an arbitrary
number of parties.
</p>

<h3>IV. Use-cases and User-scenarios</h3>

<p>
<i>Determine the types or classes of users who would use the
system, and what their experience would be like at a high-level.
Sketch what their experience would be like and what actions they would
take, and how the system would support them.</i>

<h3>VI.A Data Model Requirements</h3>

<p>
<b>10.10 Events</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>10.10.10</b> The data model represents activities associated with sets
of time intervals.  
</p>
<p>
<b>10.10.20</b> Events can optionally be associated with parties.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.10.30></b> Events can optionally recur.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.20 Time Interval Sets</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>10.20.10</b> A time interval consists of a start time and an end time.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.20.20</b> A time interval set consists of a set of associated time
intervals.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.20.30</b> Individual time intervals can be open ended.  That is, the
beginning time, ending time, or both may be null.  The exact meaning
of a null time is application dependent.  However, as a suggestion,
null end time could indicate events such as holidays or birthdays that
have no particular start time associated with them.  Null start time
could indicate a due date.  Both times null could indicate some item
that needs to be scheduled in the future but does not yet have a set
time.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.30 Activities</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>10.30.10</b> An activity has a name and a description.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.30.20</b> An activity can be associated with a set of ACS objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.30.30</b> An event object can be a valid target for an activity.
This could indicate time dependencies, e.g. for workflow or project
management.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.50 Recurring Events</b> 
</p>
<p>
<b>10.50.10</b> The data model provides a table which describes how to generate
recurrences from a base event.
</p>

<b>10.50.20</b>  Recurring on a daily basis should be supported.<p>

<b>10.50.30</b>  Recurring on a weekly basis should be supported.  For
weekly recurrences, it should be possible to specify exactly which
days of the week.<p>

<b>10.50.40</b>  Recurring every month on a particular date should be
supported.<p>

<b>10.50.50</b>  Recurring every month on a particular day of a
particular week should be supported.<p>

<b>10.50.60</b>  If a date in the 4th or 5th week of a month has been
selected, then an option should be presented allowing an item to recur
on a particular day of the last week of a month.<p>

<b>10.50.70</b>  Recurring yearly on a particular date should be supported.<p>
<p>
<b>10.50.80</b> The data model should allow an application to provide a
custom recurrence function.
<p>
<b>10.50.90</b> It should be possible to specify an end date for
recurrences.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.50.100</b> It should be possible to specify no end date for recurrences.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.50.110</b> The service should enforce reasonable limits on the
amount of data used to represent recurring events.  In other words,
it should not be possible to fill the DB with thousands of rows
representing a single recurring event, even if it recurs
indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.50.120</b> The service should provide a view for querying on
those recurrences that aren't fully populated in the DB.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>20.10.30</b> The service supports adding or deleting a party
mapping to an event.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>VII. Design and Implementation Notes</h3>

<h4>VII.A 3.4 Calendar Package</h4>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/doc/calendar/">3.4 calendar
package</a> provides some ideas for the design and implementation of the
events service.  One way to look at the service is as a
distillation of the components of the calendar data model and implementation
which would be common to any event-based application.  In particular, I
anticipate the table for recurring information will be very similar to
the calendar data model for recurring items.
</p>

<h4>VII.B Problem Set 2</h4>

<p>
Another way to look at this events service is as an
elaboration of the scheduling service in <a
href="http://www.arsdigita.com/ad-training/acs40-training">Problem Set
2 revised for ACS 4.0</a>.  The main differences are allowing multiple
time intervals, and a one to many relationship with parties and
objects.  Thus the data model will have the core event_id, and
repeat_id in the event subtype of acs_object.  Time Intervals will be
in a separate table. The parties column and object column will be
split out into separate mapping tables.
</p>

<h4>VII.C Recurring Events</h4>

<p>
There is a very important tradeoff to be made in the implementation of
recurring events.  
<a href="http://dev.arsdigita.com/doc/calendar/design.html#tradeoffs">Calendar
Design Tradeoffs</a> details this tradeoff as applied to the 3.4
calendar package.  
</p>
<p>
There are two main choices for supporting recurring events.  One
choice is to insert only a single row for each recurring event,
regardless of the number of times it will recur.  This row contains
all the information necessary to compute whether or not that event
would recur on a particular day.  The alternative is to insert a row
for each recurrence.  
</p>
<p>
I favor the second approach for the following reasons.  First, one
tradeoff is time vs. space.  Computation, particularly if it might
need to be done in Tcl and not solely in the database, is relatively
expensive compared to storing additional information in the database.
In many cases, the only information that will need to be stored for
recurrences is the date and time of the recurrence.
</p>
<p>
Another reason is that the first approach, to insert only a single
row, seems to require a significantly more complex design.  Thus the
design, implementation and eventual maintenance time would be greater.
</p>
<p>
This approach will also make it much easier to handle 
exceptions to recurrences and individualizing the objects associated
with instances of events.
<p>
However, there are drawbacks to this approach.  First, it will be more
difficult to handle events that recur indefinitely.  Second (but
related) is that safeguards will need to be put in place to prevent
pathological (accidental or intentional) cases from swamping the
database.
</p>
<p>
Another issue is that when populating the DB with recurring event
instances, there is an application-level choice that the service
needs to support.  This is the decision as to whether the new event
instances are mapped to the same object or to newly created objects.
For example, for the reservation application, the instances should be
mapped to the same room object.  Alternately, for the calendar
application, the instances should be mapped to new calendar events
so that each instance can be modified individually.
