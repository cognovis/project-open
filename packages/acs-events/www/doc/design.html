<h3>II.  Introduction</h3>

<p>
The ACS events service is primarily intended for use by writers of
application packages and other service packages. The service allows
developers to specify and manipulate relationships (possibly
recurring) between a <i>set of intervals in time</i>, an
<i>activity</i>, and an arbitrary number of <i>parties</i>. An
activity can be associated with an arbitrary number of ACS
<i>objects</i>.  
</p>
<p>
The package doesn't provide for any interpretation of events, leaving
that up to the applications that use the service.  In particular, the
package assumes that permissioning, and the related concept of
approval, will be handled by the application.  Similarly, notification
is also the responsibility of the application (but probably via
another service package.)  Likewise, the package provides no UI support.
</p>
<p>
Possible application domains include include calendaring, room
reservation, scheduling, project management, and event registration.
</p>
<p>
The requirements break the functionality into four main areas: events,
time intervals, activities, and recurrences.  The package meets the
requirements for each of these areas in the following ways:
</p>
<p>
<b>Events:</b> The service creates a new subtype of acs_object:
acs_event.  It creates an auxiliary table for mapping events to
parties.  It provides an API for manipulating and querying events and their
associated time interval sets, activities, recurrences, and parties.
</p>
<p>
<b>Time Intervals:</b> The service creates tables for storing time
intervals and sets of time intervals.  It provides an API for
manipulating and querying time intervals and time interval sets.
</p>
<p>
<b>Activities:</b> The service creates a new subtype of acs_object:
acs_activity.  It creates an auxiliary table for mapping activities to
objects.  It provides an API for manipulating activities, their
properties, and their associated objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>Recurrences:</b> The service creates a table for storing
information on how an event recurs, including how the event recurs and
when it stops recurring. It provides an API for manipulating
recurrence information and recurring events.  This includes a function
to insert event recurrences in such a way as to reasonably limit the
amount of information stored in the DB for a particular event.  This
is done by only partially populating the recurrences for certain
events.  The service also provides a view which simplifies querying to
find partially populated recurring events that need recurrences added
to the DB.
</p>


<h3>III.  Historical Considerations</h3> 

<p>
There are number of historical considerations surrounding the
design of recurring events.  Much of the current design can be traced
pack to the original <a
href="http://www.arsdigita.com/doc/calendar/design.html">ACS 3.4
Calendar Package design</a>, though the design has been
cleaned up, modified to fit with the new events data model and slightly
expanded.
</p>
<p>
One key consideration is exactly how recurring events are supported.
There are two main choices.  One
choice is to insert only a single row for each recurring event,
regardless of the number of times it will recur.  This row contains
all the information necessary to compute whether or not that event
would recur on a particular day.  The alternative is to insert a row
for each recurrence.  
</p>
<p>
I favored the second approach for the following reasons.  First, one
tradeoff is time vs. space.  Computation, particularly if it might
need to be done in Tcl and not solely in the database, is relatively
expensive compared to storing additional information in the database.
In many cases, the only information that will need to be stored for
recurrences is the date and time of the recurrence.
</p>
<p>
I think it may be faster in Oracle even with a stored proc, at least
with the month view and possibly the week view as well.  This is
because with 1 row per recurrence, the month and week view queries can
pull all the relevant items out at once and can take advantage of the
index on the start_date column to optimize the query.  With the stored
proc, it would be necessary to iterate over each day (up to 42 in the
month view), calling the check repeat proc for each base repeating
item who's repeat_until date was still relevant, and then effectively
constructing the item to be displayed.
</p>
<p>
Another reason is that the first approach, to insert only a single
row, seems to require a significantly more complex design.  Thus the
design, implementation and eventual maintenance time would be greater.
It becomes even more complex when you allow exceptions.  Now you need to
maintain a separate table of exceptions and it becomes necessary to check
through the exceptions table every time the check repeat proc is called.
It the worst case, every recurrence is an exception, so you're
essentially back to 1 row per recurrence, plus all the added complexity
of using the check repeat proc.
</p>
<p>
This is not an unreasonable possibility and is in fact how Sloan
operates.  Each class is represented as a recurring item and it is very
common for each instance to have a different set of files attached to it.
</p>
<p>
However, there are drawbacks to this approach.  First, it will be more
difficult to handle events that recur indefinitely.  Second (but
related) is that safeguards will need to be put in place to prevent
pathological (accidental or intentional) cases from swamping the
database.
</p>
<p>
In the ACS 3.4 Calendar Package, this was partially resolved in the
following way. Users are limited to looking no more than 10 years in
the past or 10 years in the future.  (Actually, this is a system
parameter and can be set more or less restrictive, but the default is
10 years.)  This seemed reasonable given that other systems seem to
have arbitrary, implementation driven limits.  Yahoo and Excite have
arbitrary limits between about 1970 and 2030.  Palm seems to have no
lower limit, but an upper limit of 2031.
</p>
<p>
The 4.0 ACS Events service doesn't enforce a particular policy to
prevent problems, but it does provide mechanisms that a well-designed
application can use.  The keys are the <b>event_recurrence.insert_events</b>
procedure and the <b>partially_populated_events</b> view.
</p>
<p>
<b>insert_events</b> takes either an event_id or a recurrence_id and a
cutoff date.  It either uses the recurrence_id, or gets it from the
event_id, to retrieve the information needed to generate the dates of
the recurrences.  When inserting a recurring event for the first time,
the application will need to call <b>insert_events</b> with a
reasonable populate_until date.  For calendar, for example, this could
be sysdate + the lookahead limit.
</p>
<p>
It is the application's responsibility to determine if additional
events need to be inserted into the DB to support the date being used
in a query to view events.  The application can do this by querying on
partially_populated_events, using the date in question and any other
limiting conditions to determine if there are any recurrences that
might recur on the date in question which have not been populated up
to that date.  To insure reasonable performance, the application needs
to be clever about tracking the current date viewed and the maximum
date viewed so as to minimize the number of times this query is
performed.  The application should also pick a date reasonably far in
the future for insert additional instances.
</p>
<p>
Another historical consideration is the choice of values for
event_recurrence.interval_type.  The original choice for the 3.4
calendar was based on the Palm DateBook which seemed fairly inclusive
(covering both Yahoo Calendar and Excite Planner) though it didn't
capture some of the more esoteric cases covered by Outlook or
(particuarly) Lotus Notes.  The Events service maintains the original
choices, but adds an additional choice, 'custom', which, when combined
with the custom_func column, allows an application to generate an
arbitrary recurrence function.  The function must take a date and a
number of intervals as arguments and return a new date greater than
the given date.  The number of intervals is guaranteed to be a
positive integer.
</p>
<p>
For the days_of_week column, the representation chosen, a
space-delimited list of integers, has a number of advantages.  First,
it is easy and reasonably efficient to generate the set of dates
corresponding to the recurrences.  <b>insert_events</b> takes each
number in the list in turn and adds it to the date of the beginning of
the week.  Second, the Tcl and Oracle representations are equivalent
and the translations to and from UI are straightforward.  In
particular, the set of checkboxes corresponding to days of the week
are converted directly into a Tcl list which can be stored directly
into the DB.
</p>

<h3>IV.  Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>
Since this is a low level service package, there is no direct competition.
</p>


<h3>V.  Design Tradeoffs</h3> 

<p>
Because this is a service package, tradeoffs were made only in areas
of interest to developers.  Indeed, the main design tradeoff was made at the
very beginning, namely that this would be a narrowly-focussed service
package.  This had consequences in the following areas:
</p>

<h4>Maintainability</h4>
<p>
To simplify the package as much as possible, a number of possible
features were left to be handled by other services or by the
applications using the events package.  This includes controlling
access to events via permissions, providing an approval process, and
providing support for notification.  permissions app dependent,
approval via workflow, separate notification service package
</p>
<p>
There was one significant, fairly complex feature that was
included, namely the support for recurrences.  It could have been left
to the application developers or another service package.  However,
because the 3.4 Calendar package already had a model for recurring
calendar items, it was straightforward to adapt this model for the
rest of the events data model.  The advantage of this is that this
code is now in one place with no need for applications to reinvent
the wheel.  It also means that there is a consistent model across the
toolkit. 
</p>

<h4>Reusability</h4>

<p>
Much thought was given to the needs of applications most likely to use
this service, such as  calendar, events, and room reservations.  This
has led to a well defined API which should be reusable by most
applications that are concerned by events.
</p>
    
<h4>Testability</h4>

<p>
Because the API consists of well defined PL/SQL functions, it should
be fairly easy to build a test suite using the PL/SQL testing tools.
</p>

<h3>VI.  Data Model and API Discussion</h3> 

<p>
The data model and PL/SQL API encapsulate the four main abstractions
defined in the ACS Events service: events, time interval sets,
activities, and recurrences.  At present, there is no Tcl API, but if
desired one could be added consisting primarily of wrappers around
PL/SQL functions and procedures.
</p>

<h4>Events</h4>

<p>
This is the main abstraction in the package.  <tt>acs_event</tt> is a
subtype of <tt>acs_object</tt>.  In addition to the
<tt>acs_events</tt> table, there is an <tt>acs_event_party_map</tt>
table which maps between parties and events.  The <tt>acs_event</tt>
package defines <tt>new</tt>, <tt>delete</tt>, various procedures to
set attributes and <tt>recurs_p</tt> indicating whether or not a
particular event recurs.
</p>

<h4>Time Interval Sets</h4>

<p>
Because time interval sets are so simple, there is no need to make
them a subtype of <tt>acs_object</tt>.  Interval sets are represented
with one table to represent time intervals, and a second table which
groups intervals into sets, with corresponding PL/SQL packages
defining <tt>new</tt>, <tt>delete</tt>, and additional manipulation functions.
</p>

<h4>Activities</h4>

<p>
This is the secondary abstraction in the package.  <tt>acs_activity</tt> is a
subtype of <tt>acs_object</tt>.  In addition to the
<tt>acs_activities</tt> table, there is an <tt>acs_activity_object_map</tt>
table which maps between objects and activities.  The <tt>acs_activity</tt>
package defines <tt>new</tt>, <tt>delete</tt>, and various procedures to
set attributes and mappings.
</p>

<h4>Recurrences</h4>

<p>
Since recurrences are always associated with events, there seemed to
be no need to make them objects.  The information that determines how
an event recurs is stored in the <tt>event_recurrences</tt> table.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>event_recurrence</tt> package defines <tt>new</tt>,
<tt>delete</tt>, and other procedures related to recurrences.  The key
procedure is <tt>insert_events</tt>.
</p>
<p>
A view, <tt>partially_populated_events</tt>, is created which hides
some of the details of retrieving recurrences that need to populated further.
</p>

<!--
    <li> Data management components: procedures that provide a stable
    interface to database objects and legal transactions - the latter
    often correspond to tasks. </li>

<p>
Remember that the correctness, completeness, and stability of the API
and interface are what experienced members of our audience are looking
for.  This is a cultural shift for us at aD (as of mid-year 2000), in
that we've previously always looked at the data models as key, and
seldom spent much effort on the API (e.g. putting raw SQL in pages to
handle transactions, instead of encapsulating them via procedures).
Experience has taught us that we need to focus on the API for
maintainability of our systems in the face of constant change. 
</p>


<p>
The data model discussion should do more than merely display the SQL
code, since this information is already be available via a link in the
"essentials" section above.  Instead, there should be a high-level
discussion of how your data model meets your solution requirements:
why the database entities were defined as they are, and what
transactions you expect to occur. (There may be some overlap with the
API section.)  Here are some starting points:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> The data model discussion should address the intended usage
of each entity (table, trigger, view, procedure, etc.) when this
information is not obvious from an inspection of the data model
itself. </li>

    <li> If a core service or other subsystem is being used (e.g., the
new parties and groups, permissions, etc.) this should also be
mentioned. </li>

    <h4>Transactions</h4>

    <li> Discuss modifications which the database may undergo from
    your package. Consider grouping legal transactions according to
    the invoking user class, i.e. transactions by an ACS-admin, by
    subsite-admin, by a user, by a developer, etc.  </li>

</ul>
