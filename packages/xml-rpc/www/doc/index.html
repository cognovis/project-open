<h2>XML-RPC Server Documentation</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
XML-RPC is a protocol which allows clients to make remote procedure calls
on your server. Data is transformed into a standard XML format before being
transferred between the client and server. This allows software using
different OS's and programming languages to interact. See <a
href="http://xml-rpc.com">XML-RPC.com</a> for more information.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Why do we need it in OpenACS?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Some XML-RPC protocols have become popular in the web world. The <a
href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/api/1_docs/">Blogger API</a> and
the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">Metaweblog API</a> allow
users to manage their blogs using tools of their choice and these have
become widespread enough that users expect to find this functionality in
any blogging software. For this reason, it's important to provide this
minimum of functionality.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>User Documentation</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are no user-facing pages. XML-RPC client software may require the
user to know the URL that is accepting XML-RPC requests, which is
admin-definable (default: http://example.com/RPC2/). XML-RPC savvy users
can call the XML-RPC method <code>system.listMethods</code> to see which
methods the server supports.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Admin Documentation</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
The server is installed by default at /RPC2/. Administrators can change
this by unmounting the package and remounting it at the desired URL. The
server can be disabled or enabled via the /admin pages. 
</p>

<p>
The XML-RPC folks have defined a standard validation suite. These tests are
implemented in the Automated Testing package, so admins can test their
server against this suite (locally) by running all the automated
tests. They can also go to http://validator.xmlrpc.com to test their site's
validity (remotely) from there.
</p>

<h4>Adding XML-RPC support to your package</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>
The first thing you need to do is write the methods that you want to be
available via XML-RPC. They should be defined as ad_procs just as any other
OpenACS procs except for 2 differences.

<ol>
  <li>
  They need to be able to <strong>accept arguments</strong> as sent to them
  from xmlrpc::decode
  
  <p>
  In XML-RPC, every value has a datatype. Since TCL is a weakly-typed
  language, we could care less about the datatype (for the most part). So
  for scalar values (int, boolean, string, double, dateTime.iso8601,
  base64), xmlrpc::decode simply sends along the value to your
  proc. <strong>To recap, for scalar values, you need to do nothing
  special.</strong> For the 2 complex types (structs and arrays), the
  values are sent to your proc as TCL structures - XML-RPC structs are sent
  TCL arrays and XML-RPC arrays are sent as TCL lists. For example, if your
  proc expects a struct with 3 members (name, address and phone), then this
  is how the beginning of your proc will look.
    
  <pre>
  array set user_info $struct
  set name $user_info(name)
  set address $user_info(address)
  set phone $user_info(phone)
  </pre>

  Or if your proc expects an array with n integers, which it then sums,
  then this is how your proc will look.
    
  <pre>
  foreach num $array {
      incr sum $num
  }
  </pre>
    
  </p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
  They need to be able to <strong>return data</strong> that xmlrpc::respond
  will be able to translate to XML.
  <p>
  Scalar data should be returned as a 2 item list {-datatype value}. So if
  your proc returns an int, its last statement might be:
  </p>

  <pre>
  return [list -int $result]
  </pre>

  Returning complex data structures (struct, array) is a little more *ahem*
  complex. One of the confusing things is the terminology. As I noted
  above, XML-RPC arrays are equivalent to TCL lists and XML-RPC structs are
  equivalent to TCL arrays. The other confusing thing is that XML-RPC is
  strongly typed and TCL isn't, so when you're converting from TCL to
  XML-RPC, you need to add the datatype for each scalar value.
  <ul>
    <li>Returning an array of mixed type
    <pre>
    return [list -array [list [list -int 36] [list -string "foo"]]]
    </pre>
    </li>

    <li>Returning a struct (foo=22, bar=blah)
    <pre>
    return [list -struct [list foo [list -int 22] bar [list -string blah]]]
    </pre>
    </li>

    <li>Returning the above struct using a TCL array
    <pre>
    set my_struct(foo) [list -int 22]
    set my_struct(bar) [list -string blah]
    return [list -struct [array get my_struct]]
    </pre>
    </li>

    <li>Returning an array of structs
    <pre>
    set user1(name) {-string "George Bush"} 
    set user1(id) {-int 41}
    set user2(name) {-string "Bill Clinton"} 
    set user2(id) {-int 42}
    return [list -array [list 
                             [list -struct [array get user1]] 
                             [list -struct [array get user2]]]]
    </pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Once your procs are defined in packagekey/tcl/foo-procs.tcl, register them
in packagekey/tcl/foo-init.tcl. The *-init.tcl files are loaded after all
the *-procs.tcl files have been loaded, so xmlrpc::register_proc will be
available if the xmlrpc package is installed. Make sure you add the xmlrpc
package as a dependency of your package if you register any XML-RPC procs.
If you don't want your package to depend on xmlrpc, you can test for the
existence of the xmlrpc_procs nsv before calling xmlrpc::register_proc
</p>

<p>
This registers 'system.listMethods'
<pre>
xmlrpc::register_proc system.listMethods
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Implementation details</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>
Here is the sequence of events in an XML-RPC call. See the documentation for each proc for more details.
<ol>
  <li>A POST request is made to your XML-RPC URL.</li>
  <li>The <code>xmlrpc::get_content</code> proc grabs the content of the
      POST request. This is a bit of a hack to cover the fact that there is
      no <code>ns_conn content</code> proc. </li>
  <li><code>xmlrpc::invoke</code> is called to process the XML
      request.</li>
  <li>If the server is disabled, a fault is returned</li>
  <li>The XML is parsed for the methodName and
      arguments. <code>xmlrpc::decode_value</code> decodes the XML-RPC
      params into TCL variables.</li>
  <li><code>xmlrpc::invoke_method</code> checks to be sure the method is
      registered and then attempts to call the OpenACS proc</li>
  <li><code>xmlrpc::invoke</code> catches any errors from this attempt and
      creates a XML-RPC fault to return to the client if so. If there was
      no error, then <code>xmlrpc::respond</code> is called to format the
      result as a XML-RPC response.</li>
  <li><code>xmlrpc::construct</code> does the heavy work of converting the
      TCL results back into valid XML-RPC params</li>
  <li>Finally, if no errors occur in this process, the result is returned
      to the client as text/xml</li>
</ol>

<p>
More details are provided in the ad_proc documentation for each proc.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>XML-RPC client</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
This package also implements a simple XML-RPC client. Any package that
needs to make XML-RPC calls can simply add a dependency to this package and
then call <code>xmlrpc::remote_call</code>. As an example, the
<code>system.add</code> method sums a variable number of ints. To call the 
<code>system.add</code> method on http://example.com/RPC2, do this:
<pre>
catch {xmlrpc::remote_call http://example.com/RPC2 system.add -int 4 -int 44 -int 23} result
set result ==> 71
</pre>

<p>
It's important to <strong>always</strong> <code>catch</code> outgoing
XML-RPC calls. If there's an error, it will be written to the catch
variable (<code>result</code> in the example above). If there's no error,
then the return value will be in <code>result</code>.
</p>

<p>
<em>Implementation detail</em>: The client needs to be able to POST
requests to other servers. The util_httppost proc in
acs-tcl/tcl/utilities-procs.tcl doesn't work because it doesn't let you
specify the Content-Type, which needs to be text/xml, and it doesn't add
Host headers, which are required if the server you're POSTing to is using
virtual hosting. So, this package implemements its own HTTP POST proc
(which was stolen from lars-blogger's weblogs.com XML-RPC ping).
</p>

<h3>History of XML-RPC in OpenACS</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
The first implementation of XML-RPC for AOLServer was ns_xmlrpc, whose credits
state:
<blockquote>
	Ns_xml conversion by Dave Bauer (dave at thedesignexperience.org) with
	help from Jerry Asher (jerry at theashergroup.com).  This code is based
	on the original Tcl-RPC by Steve Ball with contributions by Aaron
	Swartz. The original Tcl-RPC uses TclXML and TclDOM to parse the
	XML. It works fine but since OpenACS-4 will use ns_xml I converted it.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I took this version and converted it into a OpenACS service package. All of
the xml procs now use the XML abstraction procs inside acs-tcl (which
currently use tDOM). All the procs are in a xmlrpc:: namespace and
documentation has been added. I added support for some standard XML-RPC
reserved procs (system.listMethods, system.methodHelp, system.multicall). I
changed the semantics slightly in one area. XML-RPC arrays were being
converted to TCL arrays, with the name of each item being an integer
index. I thought it made more sense to make these TCL lists (since that is
what a TCL list is anyways). It makes the code more consistent and makes it
easier to understand how to deal with XML-RPC datatypes.
<blockquote>
XML-RPC struct = TCL array. <br>
XML-RPC array = TCL list.
