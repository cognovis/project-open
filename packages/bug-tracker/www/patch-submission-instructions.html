    <h1>Submitting a Patch</h1>

    <p>
      The very short answer is <code>diff -u</code> or
      better, <code>cvs diff -u</code> and in either case you should
      then inspect the resulting patch file to insure that it is what
      you expect and manually remove any changes which should not be
      part of the submitted patch. <em>For people not using GNU diff,
        -u and -N may not work, use -c for context diffs, and
        <code>diff /dev/null filename</diff> to generate a diff to
          create a file</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>The best way: Make changes in a current cvs checkout</h2>
    
    <p> 
      If you have made changes in a cvs checkout just type
      <blockquote>
        <code>cvs diff -Nu package-dir &gt; patch-file</code> 
      </blockquote>
      in the package /web/openacs-4/package directory to generate
      the patch (see below if you have also added files).
    </p>

    <h2>The bad way</h2>
    <p>
      If you are working from code that is not a cvs checkout
      (definitely less desirable, see below) then you should type
      either:
      <blockquote>
        <code>diff -u package-dir/.../old-file  package-dir/.../new-file &gt; patch-file</code> 
      </blockquote>
      or if you have modified more than one file you might want to do
      <blockquote>
        <code>diff -rNu old-package-dir new-package-dir &gt; patch-file</code>
      </blockquote>
      which will do a recursive context diff of the old directory versus the
      new directory (the <code>-r</code> flag) and generate patches which
      will create new files if you have added files (the <code>-N</code>
      flag).
    </p>

    <h2>Gory Details</h2>

    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>
      We prefer patches be generated from the top-level directory of
      the package so that it is clear from the patch where the file 
      belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>-N</code> flag will generate a chunk in the patch file
      to create any new files you have added but please be careful
      that the files that will created really should be part of the
      patch.  It is easy to have editor backup file and others show up
      (although cvs diff generally does not have this problem).
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to avoid reformatting large blocks of code unless absolutely
      necessary.  It is quite important that the changes be as small as
      possible so the the patch maintainer can inspect the patch quickly
      and apply it if needed.
    </p>

    <h3>cvs diff</h3>

    <p>
      If you have cvs commit and are going to commit your changes but
      want to produce a diff for documentation purposes you should 
      <code>cvs add</code> any new files you have made first so that 
      cvs diff will produce a diff which will create the new files.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are working from an anonymous checkout you should do the 
      following to add diffs for new files to the patch file:
      <blockqoute> 
        <code>diff -u /dev/null package-dir/.../new-file &gt;&gt; patch-file</code>
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <h3>Non-cvs checkout</h3>
    <p>
      In an ideal world you would do a checkout from the head, make
      your changes, test them, and submit a <code>cvs diff</code> as 
      above.  If you are unwilling to do so, a diff based patch is
      still useful to the project but is less likely to be applied 
      as quickly (if at all).  Posting entire changed files is almost 
      useless since it is difficult and time consuming to find 
      what you have changed and such postings are entirely likely 
      to be rejected outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      if you have new files to add to your patch, add them to the 
      patch file via:
      <blockqoute> 
        <code>diff -u /dev/null new-file &gt;&gt; patch-file</code>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
