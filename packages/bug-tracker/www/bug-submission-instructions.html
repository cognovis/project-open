    <h1>Writing a good bug report</h1>

There are some simple guidelines to writing ticket which will make
prioritizing, tracking, and resolving problems more efficient.  
    <p>
    <UL>
      <LI> Each ticket should relate to a single problem or feature.
      <LI> Provide a descriptive subject.
      <LI> Be as specific as possible about what is wrong.
      <LI> Put the URL to the offending page in the ticket.
      <LI> Describe the steps you took to produce the problem.
      <LI> Provide sensible priorities and deadlines.
    </UL>
    <h2>Justification</h2>
    
    <h3>Each ticket should relate to a single problem or feature</h3>
    In order to easily prioritize and track tasks we need to have a
    state associated with each issue.  The problem with "laundry list"
    tickets is that some tasks get done, some get defered, and some
    cancelled.  It is never clear when the ticket is done and
    individual fixes can't be approved so even if it nominally is done
    things are likely to fall through the cracks.

      <h3> Provide a descriptive subject </h3>
    We look at summaries of tickets with subjects only and it is
    much easier to find the relevant ticket with a descriptive subject.

      <h3> Be as specific as possible about what is wrong </h3>

    Problem descriptions that are too short or ambiguous are less
    likely to get fixed than those that can be easily interpreted.
    
      <h3> Put the URL to the offending page in the ticket </h3>

    Having the URL in the problem description will streamline finding,
fixing, and
    verifying the ticket.  You do not have to enter it as an HTML
    href, simply including the full url ( including the http:// and
    the trailing variables ) is sufficient.

      <h3> Describe the steps you took to produce the problem </h3>

  If we cannot reproduce your problem it will be much harder to find.
  The problem can be related to the page visited proir to the page on
  which the error occurs or may be related to the specific data you
  input to a form.

      <h3> Provide sensible priorities and deadlines </h3>

    <p>    
    We make an effort to meet deadlines and fix things in priority
    order but if all tickets are critical with a short deadline
    we will not necessarily fix them in the order you would really
    like. Here is an explanation of what the priority and severety
    codes mean:
    </p>

    <p>
    Severity
      <ol>
        <li> Critical. System crash, security violation, or data loss.</li>
        <li> No Workaround. Because of this bug, a function cannot be made to work.</li>
        <li> Workaround. The bug interferes with functionality but an alternative</li>
        <li> Cosmetic. The bug does not interfere with functionality.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    Priority
      <ol>
        <li>Must be fixed by next release</li>
        <li>Should be fixed by next release</li>
        <li>Might be fixed</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
