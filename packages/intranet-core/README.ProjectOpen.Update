  3a. Upgrade Procedure on Linux/Unix


  This upgrade procedure assumes that you have extracted this README
  file in /tmp/ and that ]po[ has been installed as user "projop" 
  in the folder /web/projop/. Please change the script below according
  to your actual installation.

  Basically, we will replace the /web/projop/packages folder by
  the /packages/ directory included in this upgrade:

  # su - projop
  # mv packages packages.old
  # mv /tmp/packages.X.Y.Z.V.W packages
  # killall -9 nsd (restart your AOLServer)

  Please continue the procedure with step 4. below.

  3b. Upgrade Procedure on Win32


  This upgrade procedure assumes that you have extracted this README
  file in C:\temp\ and that ]po[ has been installed in the folder
  C:\project-open\. Please change the script below according to your 
  actual installation.

  Basically, we will replace the C:\project-open\packages folder by
  the C:\temp\packages.X.Y.Z.V.W folder:

  - Go to Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services
    and stop the "project-open AOLServer" service.
  - Rename C:\project-open\packages into C:\project-open\packages.old
  - Move C:\temp\packages.X.Y.Z.V.W to C:\project-open\
  - Rename C:\temp\packages.X.Y.Z.V.W to C:\project-open\packages\
  - Start the "project-open AOLServer" service.

  4. Running ]po[ Upgrade Scripts

  
  Once the code has been updated, we need to update the SQL data model
  in order to match the code.

  - Login as a ]po[ Administrator
  - Go to the "Home" page at /intranet/index
  - Please follow the upgrade instructions in the upper right hand side
    of the Home page. Depending on the age of your previous version you 
    may have to restart the server several times.
