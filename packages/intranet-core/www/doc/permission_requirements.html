            <h1>User Permissions and Access Rights</h1>
            <p>The management of permissions and access rights is the most complicated 
              element of ]project-open[ because it really is a management of trust 
              relationships. There is a dilema between:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Access: Users should have access to all information and documents 
                necessary to do their job.</li>
              <li>Restriction: Users should not have access to more information 
                then necessary to do their job.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To solve this dilema ]project-open[ introduces three types of access 
              permissions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;User Profiles&quot; which correspond to department membership 
                in a company</li>
              <li>&quot;Project Roles&quot; which correspond to the function of 
                the user in a specific project and</li>
              
  <li>&quot;User Hierarchy&quot; which corresponds to the reporting hierarchy 
                in a company.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these concepts are explained below.</p>
            <h2><a name=user_profile id="user_profile"></a>User Profiles</h2>
            <p>User profiles correspond to department membership in the company 
              or business partners respectively. </p>
            <p><img src="screenshots/user_permissions_vert.gif" width="372" height="374"> 
            </p>
            <p>The figure above depicts the different types of User Profiles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Senior Management: The management of the company with access 
                to all corporate information</li>
              <li>Project Managers: Employees with special skills to manage projects</li>
              <li>Employees: Employees from several departments such as sales, 
                operations, ...</li>
              <li>Finance: Employees with access to invoices and other financial 
                information<br>
              </li>
              <li> Freelancers: External users who can take part in specific projects. 
                Freelancers have basically no access rights outside the specific 
                projects they take part of.</li>
              <li>Clients: External users with permissions similar to Freelancers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that the groups Employees, Freelancers and Clients 
              are mutally exclusive. </p>
            <h2><a name=project_roles id="project_roles"></a>Project Roles</h2>
            <p>Project roles define access permissions to project on a case-by-case 
              base. Project roles are particularly useful for &quot;Freelancers&quot; 
              and &quot;Clients&quot; with normally very restricted access to 
              the system.</p>
            <p><img src="screenshots/user_permissions_horiz.gif" width="369" height="315"></p>
            <p>The figure above depicts a &quot;Project B&quot; that involves 
              project members from both the provider and the company side. </p>
            <p>Project Roles can be extended and customized for a specific company. 
              However, a number of predefined project roles exist:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Administrator</strong>: <br>
                The administrator of a project can assign new users to the project 
                and change its main characteristics. Also, the enjoys full read 
                and write access to all associated components such as discussion 
                forums and filestorage.</li>
              <li><strong>Member</strong>: <br>
                A member has access to all information of a business object but 
                is not allowed to administer the object.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Project/Translation adds several translation specific roles such 
              as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Translator</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Editor</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Proof Reader</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2><a name=user_hierarchy id="user_hierarchy"></a>User Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>The user hierarchy determines which user has the right to &quot;administer&quot; 
              (change the password and email, ...) other users. The hierarchy 
              consists of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>System Administrator</li>
              <li>Senior Management</li>
              <li>Employees</li>
              <li>Freelancers and Companies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Being able to administer a user is particularly useful in cases 
              where the user has forgotten his password or has otherwise problems 
              to work with the system.</p>
