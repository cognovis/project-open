<h1>The Big Picture</h1>
<p>... written by a lot of people  at <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/">ArsDigita</a></p>
The faster the pace of change in an industry or 
business, the more time and effort workers have to spend on coordination. 
Consider Adam Smith's pin factory. The boss has to stand up in front of the 
workers once per year and say "Thank you for your fine work last year. This 
year, I want you to make lots of pins. They should be really straight, blunt on 
one end, and pointy on the other. See you next year." In a university literature 
department, you need to have a meeting once per semester. Perhaps some of the 
curriculum should be revised? In a business facing innovative competitors, you 
need to have a meeting once every month to think about required responses. In a 
complex organization that is try to change and adapt, meetings and other forms 
of coordination may consume 20-30 hours per week. 
<P>Why is this a problem? People still have to work 40 hours per week to get 
anything done. The result is that people will have to spend 60-70 hours per week 
at the office in order to coordinate and work. 
<P>What's the solution to this social problem? A computer program of course! 
(You didn't expect anything better from three MIT graduates did you?) 
<P>A modern organization exhibits the classical problem at which Web-based 
applications excel: people separated in time and space. We can thus use the same 
toolkit that we developed for helping people work together and teach each other 
over the Internet to work together within an organization. 
<H3>For What Kinds of Organizations Is This Best?</H3>
What kinds of 
organizations can get the most out of this toolkit? Ones just like ArsDigita, of 
course! We built this for ourselves. ArsDigita currently (May 2000) has 
approximately ten offices, 140 busy highly-paid people, and rapid growth 
(revenue doubling every six months). Coincidentally, it also works great for 
groups within larger companies. Consider Jane Manager at Hewlett-Packard who is 
forming a team to build a new product. Within a couple of weeks, she might be 
managing 100 people spread out among four physical locations in Japan, 
California, the Pacific Northwest, and Spain. That's much faster organizational 
growth and change than any startup company will ever experience. It would be 
awfully nice if Jane could go up to a Web browser and ask "Who works for me 
today? What are their names? What do they look like? How do I get in touch with 
them?" 
<H3>The Medium-Size Picture</H3>
We assume that all the employees are users in a 
standard ArsDigita Community System. We keep track of employees, companies, 
project, salaries, and deadlines. This enables us to ask questions like 
<UL>
  <LI>How many people work in this organization and how much money are we 
  spending each month on salaries? 
  <LI>Who works for whom? (fun with Oracle tree extensions) 
  <LI>What are our upcoming deadlines? 
  <LI>What is John Smith working on? 
  <LI>Which people are on the CNN project? 
  <LI>How much time did that project take? 
  <LI>What current issues and problems we are facing? 
  <LI>What has this project involved so far? </LI>
</UL>
For companies that operate 
an Internet service based on our toolkit, a side benefit of using our intranet 
module is that employees who develop skills in maintaining the intranet can then 
apply those skills to the public Web services. Novices have to start out 
somewhere and they might as well start in a place where an error isn't observed 
by companies. 
<P>One of the key components to any intranet is keeping members of the company 
up-to-date. The intranet makes it easy to spam the entire company, a specific 
office, or employees working on a given project.
