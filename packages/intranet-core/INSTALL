  2. Installation Overview

  It will probably take you 15 minutes to go through the following 
  steps:
  
	- Check that the prerequisites are OK
  
	- Setup "AOLServer". AOLServer is a webserver, similar to 
	Apache. It acts as the application server that interprets 
	the ]project-open[ source code.
  
	- Extract the ]project-open[ source code tree
  
	- Setup the PostgreSQL database and import the ]po[ demo
	system.
  
	- Start the system for the first time
  
	- Automate backup, maintenance and system restart.
	This is only necessary for a production installation
	of the server.
  
	- Check for the latest version and updates

  4. Main Installation Procedure
  
  
  4.1. Install AOLServer
  
  AOLServer is the application server of ]project-open[. It is similar
  to Apache, but includes a built-in compiler for the TCL language.
  AOLServer is _the_ server of AOL and is known to deliver up to 
  2.5 million pages/second (no typo!).
  
  # cd /usr/local/
  # tar xzf aolserver3.3oacs.tgz 
  
  Check that AOLServer is working:
  
  # /usr/local/aolserver3.3oacs/bin/nsd -h
  => Usage: /usr/local/aolserver3.3oacs/bin/nsd [...] 
  
  
  
  
  4.1. UnTar the ]project-open[ Source Tree
  
  The default location for ]project-open[ is /web/. This is handy if
  you have several servers and if the main purpose of your computer
  is to run web servers. You can use a different directory, but you'll
  have to change paths in the config.tcl and later in the application
  configuration. So we RECOMMEND that you stick with /web/, at least for 
  the purpose of the first installation.
  
  # cd /
  # mkdir /web
  # cd /web
  # tar xzf project-open.3-4-0-0-0.tgz
  
  
  
  4.2. Create a new User and Group
  
  You can run ]project-open[ using any user/group that you want.
  So we recommend that you create a separate user/group for it for
  security reasons. We usually choose the same name for the user
  and the group:
  
  # groupadd projop
  # useradd -g projop -d /web/projop projop

  Once we've created the user we can set the permissions for the 
  /web/projop/ directory:
  
  # cd /web
  # chown -R projop:projop projop
  
  Now you should be able to login as "projop":
  # su - projop



  4.3. Verify the Config File
  
  The config.tcl configuration file in /web/projop/etc/ tells AOLServer 
  where to start action. Please verify the first 10 or so lines for the 
  IP address and port and adapt the values to your configuration.
  Here are the sample values that are delivered with the installer:
  
  
	#------------------------------------------------------
	# change to 80 and 443 for production use
	set httpport		8080
	set httpsport		8443
	
	# The name of the server and its location
	set server		"projop"
	set servername		"ProjectOpen Test Server"
	
	# The hostname and address should be set to actual values.
	set hostname		[ns_info hostname]
	set address		"0.0.0.0"
  
  
  
  4.4. Setup the PostgreSQL Database
  
  We are going to create a database "projop" and load a preconfigured demo
  system into this database:
  
  Check that PostgreSQL up and running ("postgres" is the default
  database administrator account. All PostgreSQL installers on SuSE, 
  RedHat and Debian setup this account by default).
  
  # su - postgres
  # psql --help
  => This is psql 7.4.7, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. [...]
  
  Create a new user. The new user should be a database admin (-a, -d)
  because these privileges are needed in order to setup the full-text
  search engine:
  
  Create a new user, a new database and a language in the database:

  #postgres:~> createuser -a -d projop
  #postgres:~> createdb --owner=projop projop
  #postgres:~> createlang plpgsql projop
  => May say that "plpgsql" is already installed, that's OK.
  
  
  
  4.5. Load the Demo Data into the Database
  
  There are two demo configurations coming with this server:
  
  - ]project-consulting[ is a small consulting company with
    some 10 employees. This setup is also suitable for 
    advertising agencies, engineering offices, IT departments
    of larger companies etc.
  
  
  - ]project-translation[ is a small translation company with
    some 10 employees. This setup is also suitable for
    localization companies and translation departments of
    larger companies.
  
  - For ]project-lifecycle[ or ]project-agency[ please use the
    ]project-consulting[ demo. These three products are very
    similar and distinguished mainly by configuration.


  #su - projop
  #projop:~> cd /web/projop/packages/intranet-core/preconf
  #projop:~> psql projop -f pc.preconf.sql	# ]project-consulting[
  
  or 
  
  #projop:~> psql projop -f pt.preconf.sql	# ]project-translation[
  
  
  Loading the files may take some 1-2 minutes. It is OK if you
  see ERROR messages in the beginning talking about missing "tables"
  or missing "functions".
  
  Check that the file has been loaded OK:
  
  #projop:~> psql projop
  #projop => select count(*) from users;
  
  => 192
  

  4.6. Customize your Login Screen

  There are two demo configurations for the login screens, one for
  ]project-consulting[ and one for ]project-translation[.


  # su - projop
  # cp /web/projop/packages/intranet-core/preconf/pt.index.tcl /web/projop/www/index.tcl
  # cp /web/projop/packages/intranet-core/preconf/pt.index.adp /web/projop/www/index.adp

  You can check for the availability of the screen when starting AOLServer
  in the next step.


  
  4.7. Start the Server for the First Time
  
  Now we are ready to start the server. We are going to run it in
  "foreground mode" to get all debugging messages on the terminal.
  (The "\" indicates a continuation of the command line):
  
  # /usr/local/aolserver3.3oacs/bin/nsd -f -t /web/projop/etc/config.tcl \
    -u projop -g projop
  
  => You should get hundereds of lines of debugging output.
  => After about 30 seconds you should see a line like this:
     [...][...][...]	Notice: nssock: listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
  
  Congratulations!
  
  
  If you should enconter errors please check the output for occurrence 
  of the "error:" string. ]po[ gives quite detailed error messages that 
  allow you track down any error. Please check the "Open Discussion" forum 
  at http://sourceforge.net/projects/project-open for help. 
  Please include the first(!) line of your log file containing "error:"
  if you post.
  
  To check that the server is running file please start a Web browser
  on your local computer with the URL "http://localhost:8080" or choose
  a suitable URL if you start the browser at a different computer.
  


  4.8. Update the Parameters and Configuration

  The parameters in your system should be set for a Windows installation
  right now (after importing the preconfigured demo contents).
  To convert these parameters to Linus please use the 
  "Convert parameters from Windows to Linux" link in the "Admin"
  menu.

  Please point your favourinte web browser to "Admin" -> "Parameters" 
  in order to check the parameters manually. The filestorage pathes should 
  now all be set to /web/projop/... (instead of "C:/ProjectOpen/..." in 
  Windows). Please check the "HomeBasePathUnix". It should become
  "/web/projop/filestorage/home" under Linux.

  Also, decide whether you want to allow people to register themselves
  to accesss your server or whether you want to confirm membership.

  For more information on parameters and configuration please check
  the PO-Configuration-Guide in the /web/projop/filestorage/home
  folder or just check in Google for "project-open configuration-guide".
  

  
  4.9. Automate Server Restart
  
  AOLServer usually runs for weeks in our productive installations without a 
  restart. However, you want to make sure the server "comes back" if
  it's been stopped (for example after the installation of a new package).
  
  To do this, please stop any running AOLServer instances and include 
  the following line in your "InitTab" (the "\" indicates a continuation 
  of the same line):
  
  #vi /etc/inittab
  
  And add somewhere the line:
  
  ns1:345:respawn:/usr/local/aolserver3.3oacs/bin/nsd -it /web/projop/etc/config.tcl \
  -u projop -g projop
  
  This line tells "Init" to restart the server in case it has stopped.
  Then tell "init" to read the InitTab again:
  
  #init q
  
  
  Check with "top" or "tail -f /web/projop/log/error.log" that the server
  starts. 
  There have been reports that "init q" wouldn't work on a Debian 
  system. In this case please reboot your system. Let us know if you
  have found/resolved this behaviour.

  You can test the restart behaviour by killing AOLServer the "hard way".
  Your server should "come back" within 1-2 minutes automatically.
  
  #killall -9 nsd
  
  
  
  4.10. Automate PostgreSQL Maintenance
  
  PostgreSQL requires you to execute a "vacuumdb" command regularly
  in order to reorganize and cleanup the database. Please add a line to your
  "crontab":
  
  #crontab -e
  
  And then add the following line to schedule a "vacuum" at 3:20am every day:
  
  20 3 * * * su - postgres -c "/usr/bin/vacuumdb -a -f" >> /var/log/vacuumdb.log 2>&1
  
  
  
  4.11. Automate PostgreSQL Backup
  
  It is advisable to schedule PostgreSQL backups every day, or even
  every few hours (the database is usually quite small, so that it's
  save to backup during times of low system use such as 5am, 1pm, 9pm).
  
  Load your "crontab" into an editor:

  #crontab -e

  Then add a line like this (make sure /var/log/backup/ exists and is 
  writable for the user "postgres"):
  
  9 5 * * * /root/bin/backup-postgres > /var/log/backup/export_postgres.`/bin/date \
  +\%Y\%m\%d.\%H\%M`.log 2>&1
  
  Here is a sample file to initiate the backup:
  
	#
	# /root/bin/backup-postgres
	# V1.1, 060115 Frank Bergmann <frank.bergmann@project-open.com>
	#
	
	# Backup to a directory that is written to tape every day:
	exportdir=/web/projop/filestorage/backup
  
	# Make sure this log directory is writable for user "postgres"
	logdir=/var/log/backup
  
	# PostgreSQL Admin account
	PG_OWNER=postgres
  
	# Add a timestamp to all database dumps:
	CURRENT_TIME=`/bin/date +\%Y\%m\%d.\%H\%M`
	
	# --------------- "projop" Database on "berlin" ----------------
	#
	COMPUTER_NAME=berlin
	SERVICE_NAME=projop
	export_file=$exportdir/pgback.$COMPUTER_NAME.$SERVICE_NAME.$CURRENT_TIME.sql
	log_file=$logdir/export-postgres.$SERVICE_NAME.$CURRENT_TIME.log
	echo su - $SERVICE_NAME --command="pg_dump -c -O -F p -f $export_file"
	su - $SERVICE_NAME --command="pg_dump -c -O -F p -f $export_file" > $log_file 2>&1
	bzip2 $export_file

  You need to make this file writable:

  #chmod ug+x /root/bin/backup-postgres  
  


  
  4.12. Check for the Latest Version and Updates
  

  Please check http://www.project-open.org/en/install_win32_340 for
  release notes and http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/project-open/ for news
  and announcements. You can subscribe yourself to the project to get updated
  about new packages, security updates etc.
  
  Please send us your email address if you are planning to use ]po[ in your 
  company. This way we will send you a ~quarterly newsletter and alert you in 
  urgent cases.
  
  On Sourceforge check for the latest announcement of a stable release.

  For example the latest at the time this document was created was "v3-4-0-0-0". The
  upgrade to this release (necesary if you install this
  installer - there are updates with respect to Invoices):

  # su - projop
  # cd /web/projop/packages
  # cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.project-open.net:/home/cvsroot update -r v3-4-0-0-0 -Pd

  After this please go to your your server URL http://localhost/acs-admin/apm/,
  choose "Install Packages" and select all packages that "Upgrade" (please don't
  install packages if you don't know what they are doing).

  The same process is available as the "Automated Software Update Service".
  ASUS is free at the moment, but we plan to charge a small amount per month 
  for its use in the future.
