    This callback is executed before im_timesheet_task_list_component is rendered / the sql command actually executed.

    The callback implementation needs to run ad_script_abort in the uplevel, so you don't execute the SQL statement and try to render the component.

    @param view_name view_name used to render the columns.
    @param view_type The view_type. This can be anything, empty string usually means you want to render the component
    @param sql The SQL string which im_timesheet_task_list_component prepares
    @param table_header Name of the table in the spreadsheet (e.g. in Excel).
