    Generic audit for all types of objects.
    @param object_id The object that may have changed
    @param object_type We can save one SQL statement if the calling side already knows the type of the object
    @param action One of {before|after} + '_' + {create|update|delete} or {view}:
		Create represent object creation.
		Update is the default.
		Delete refers to a "soft" delete, marking the object as deleted
		Nuke represents complete object deletion - should only be used for demo data.
		Before_update represents checks before the update of important objects (im_costs,
		im_project). This way the system can detect changes from outside the system.
