# ----------------------------------------------------
# Import scripts from Lexcelera
# ----------------------------------------------------

The scripts in this folder have been used to import data from
a legacy Access application at Lexcelera into ]project-open[.

As a first step we have imported the Access database into 
PostgreSQL using a commercial database converter.

In a second step we ran the scripts in this folder to insert
]po[ objects for each of the Access objects.

Please do NOT expect that these scripts will work for you
out of the box. Instead, the scripts are provided here as
a code sample. You will have to adapt these scripts to the
data structure of your own application.

Please note that this method of importing data is considerably
less efficient than the "flat-table-import" in a neighbouring
folder.

Bests,
Frank
