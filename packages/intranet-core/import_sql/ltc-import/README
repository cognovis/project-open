# Import scripts for LTC-Organizer
# ----------------------------------------------------

The scripts in this folder have been used to import data from
an LTC-Organizer 2.0 application into ]project-open[.

As a first step we have imported the Access database into 
PostgreSQL using a commercial database converter.

In a second step we ran the scripts in this folder to insert
]po[ objects for each of the Access objects.

Please note that these scripts will probably not work out of
the box for you. You will have to adapt these scripts to the
data structure of your own application.

Please note that this method of importing data is considerably
less efficient than the "flat-table-import" in a neighbouring
folder.

Bests,
Frank
