# ----------------------------------------------------
# Legacy Data Import
# ----------------------------------------------------

This folder contains several examples on how to import legacy
data into ]project-open[.

These scripts have been created during specific customer rollout
projects. Please do NOT expect that these scripts will work for 
you out of the box. Instead, you will have to adapt these structure 
to your data structures and fix any errors ocurring during the 
conversion.

You will need reasonable knowledge of SQL and the PostgreSQL
database to perform this task.

- Flat-Table-Import
  Preferred import method, developed during the import of data 
  at ISSA. Please note that project were not imported finally,
  so there may still be errors in that section.

- LTC-Import:
  Import of data from LTC-Organizer into ]project-open[

- Lexcelera:
  Import of data from a proprietary Access application into
  ]project-open[


If you encounter issues during the import:

- Please be patient. 
  It usually takes one day of work to import one object type 
  (5 days for importing users, companies, projects, price list 
  and skills), even for persons with proven ]po[ database 
  skills.

- Please learn about the ]po[ data model:
  Please search Google for "PO-Data-Model".

- Please learn PL/SQL:
  It will pay off if you dedicate half a day to learn the
  basics of PL/SQL.


Bests,
Frank
