# ----------------------------------------------------
# Flat Table Import
# ----------------------------------------------------

The scripts in this folder have been used to import data from
a customer organization into ]project-open[ during a project
rollout.

- In a first step, we have exported all customer data into CSV
  format (MS-Excel).

- In a second step, we paste the contents of the CSV files
  right into the "COPY" sections of the import.sql file.
  This way, the script automatically populates the import_*
  tables with this data.

- In a third step the SQL script converts the data from the
  import_* tables into ]po[ objects.



Please do NOT expect that these scripts will work for you
out of the box. Instead, the scripts are provided here as
a code sample. You will have to adapt these structure of 
the import_* tables to your data structures and fix any
errors ocurring during the conversion.

Still, this is currently the most efficient method to import
legacy data into ]project-open[, apart from the CSV import
provided under "Companies" and "Users" tabs.

Bests,
Frank
