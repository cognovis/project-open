  2. Prerequisites

  - OpenACS 5.3:
    This installer has been developed and tested under OpenACS 5.3.2. 
    However, we also expect the installer to work with OpenaCS 5.1 and 5.2, 
    but we haven't tested this yet.

  - PostgreSQL:
    This installer should run on the following versions of PostgreSQL:
    8.0.1, 8.0.8, 8.0.12, 8.1.5, 8.1.8, 8.1.9, 8.1.11, 8.2.4, 8.2.5
    Other PG versions should also be OK, but without the TSearch2 full
    text search module.

  - AOLServer:
    ]po[ runs on any AOLServer 3.3oacs or higher. 
    ]po[ uses "exec" for filestorage. This may lead to memory leaks with
    some AOLServer versions.

  - Other Software:
	- ]po[ requires GraphViz to render workflow diagrams.

  4. Installation

  IMPORTANT: Please backup all of your data before installing ]po[.

  In order to install ]po[, please copy the contained packages (in the
  "packages" folder of this installer) into the /web/<server>/packages/
  directory of your OpenACS installation.

  Then point your browser to the URL /acs-admin/apm/, choose "Install
  Packages" and select all "]project-open[ *" packages, except for:

  - IMPORTANT: Please don't install the package "intranet-search-pg".
    ]po[ will install this package later due to funky TSearch2 quirks.

  - The packages "intranet-helpdesk", "intranet-confdb" and 
    "intranet-release-mgmt" are in a pre-alpha status. Install these
    packages only if you want a preview of the upcoming ]po[ solution 
    for IT Services Management (ITSM).


  Then proceed as normal. The package manager will possibly select a 
  number of additional OpenACS packages to install. All dependencies
  should be satisfied.

  5. Post-Installation Activities


  Please read thought the "PO-Configuration-Guide" (contained in this
  installer in the /manuals/ folder) for an overview on configuration
  tasks.
  ]po[ is based on OpenACS, but we have decided to handle a lot of things 
  differently from OpenACS, particularly in the are of permissions and 
  GUI interface. The config guide will help you a lot to understand these 
  differences.


  5.1. System Configuration Wizard

  This  is a wizard that allows you to disable unnecessary functionality
  in order to get a useful system. To do so, please go to the /intranet/ 
  URL and click on "Next >>" button in the "System Configuration Wizard" 
  component. Then select (for an IT consulting company):

	- Business Sector:		Information Technology
	- Company or Department?:	"Other / Everything"
	- Simplified or Complete Install?: Complete / Full Installation
	- Size of your Organization:	Three hierarchical levels
	- Name and Email:		<whatever you like>
	- Logo:				<whatever you like>
	- Trust Model:			<Keep default>

  ]po[ will disable translation specific components and enable the full-text 
  search engine.
  Now please restart the server.


  5.2. Patch OpenACS:

  There is exactly one patch required for ]po[ to run on OpenACS 5.3.2.
  Please insert the following lines in /acs-templating/tcl/date-procs.tcl
  behind the equivalent "sql_date" and "ansi" sections (line 294).

	sql_timestamp {
		if { [empty_string_p $date] } { return "NULL" }
		set value ""
		set format ""
		set space ""
		set pad "0000"
		foreach { index sql_form } { 0 YYYY 1 MM 2 DD 3 HH24 4 MI 5 SS } {
		set piece [lindex $date $index]
		if { ![string equal $piece {}] } {
			append value "$space[string range $pad [string length $piece] end]$piece"
			append format $space
			append format $sql_form
			set space " "
		}
		set pad "00"
		}
		return "to_timestamp('$value', '$format')"
	}


  5.3. Filestorage Integration

  ]po[ comes with its own filestorage that integrates with existing
  SAMBA / Windows Fileserver installations. Please see the PO-Filestorage-Guide
  and the PO-Configuration-Guide for details.

  For a test installation it is OK to create a directory /web/<server>/filestorage/
  with subdirectories backup, companies, home, projects, templates and users.
  Then please adapt the parameters in intranet-filestorage and intranet-core
  to this location, maintaining the respectiv subdirector ("home", "projects" etc.).


  5.4. Reporting Engine

  You need to setup the hierarchical menu structure for reports.
  To do this please point your browser to the URL /intranet/admin/menus/.
  The page will take several seconds to load. That is all.


  5.5 Setup the Site-Master

  Please set the "DefaultMaster" parameter in Admin -> Parameters to the
  value "/packages/intranet-core/www/po-master" in order to get a uniform
  ]po[ design suitable for an Intranet.


  5.6. Reactivate the ]po[ Calendar

  The basic OpenACS 5.3.2 installation contains an error in the calendar module.
  For this reason we have disabled the calendar for ]po[ by default.

  To re-enable the calendar please go to Admin -> Components, click on
  "Home Calendar Component" and set the "Location" to "left".


  ______________________________________________________________________

  6. Setup Basic Data:

  ]po[ requires you to enter data in a certain order. Please follow
  the following steps in order to setup some basic data:

  - Companies:
	- Go to Companies -> Add a new Company:
	  Create a new "internal" company (please see the 
	  PO-Configuration-Guide" about why and how).
	- Go to Companies -> Add a new Company:
	  Create a "Sample Customer" with status "active" and 
	  type "Customer"
	- Go to Companies -> Add a new Company:
	  Create a "Sample Provider" with status "active and 
	  type "Provider"
	
  - Users:
	- Go to Users -> 
	  Create atleast one user of group "Employee", "Customer" 
	  and "Freelancer".

  - Projects:
	- Please create a sample project for each of the types 
	  "Consulting Project", "Release Item" and "Release Project".
	  These project types have certain componetns associated
	  that are only shown with projects of that type.

  - Permissions:
	- Please go once through all optios of the Admin menu
	  and consult the PO-Configuration-Guide.

  7. Upgrade and Removal

  IMPORTANT: The ]po[ intranet-*-drop.sql scripts have not been tested
  yet and will likely produce error.

  Please backup your data before installing ]project-open[, so that you
  can reverse the installation.
