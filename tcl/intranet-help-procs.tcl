<h2>Exploring the System</h2>

<p>
We have set up a sample system for you in order to show you how
a typical company could look like. Please follow the links to
explore the (freely invented) sample contents.
</p>


<h2>Using Project/Open in Your Company</h2>

<p>
This sample configuration could already serve you as the base for a
small company's system if you change the data of the existing users, 
customers and providers and replace them with your real data.
</p><p>
However, the security settings and the database of this demo are not 
suitable for production use. For a more suitable configuration please 
consult the system documentation above or 
<A href=\"http://www.project-open.com/contact/\">contact us</a>
in order to plan and execute a more formal implantation project
covering aspects such as training, maintenance, Internet connectivity,
backup and recovery etc.
